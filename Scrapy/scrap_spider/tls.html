			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<p align="justify">
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>This page is about the Lucky 13 attack on CBC-mode encryption in TLS. For details on the security of RC4 encryption in TLS, click <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/index.html">here.</a></b>
			</p>

			
				
			<p> 
			The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol aims to provide 
confidentiality and integrity of data in transit across untrusted 
networks like the Internet. It is widely used to secure web traffic and 
e-commerce transactions on the Internet. Datagram TLS (DTLS) is a 
variant of TLS that is growing in importance. 

We have found new attacks against TLS and DTLS that allow a 
Man-in-the-Middle attacker to recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS 
connection when CBC-mode encryption is used. The attacks arise from a 
flaw in the TLS specification rather than as a bug in specific 
implementations. 

We have carried out experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the 
attacks against the OpenSSL and GnuTLS implementations of TLS, and we 
have studied the source code of other implementations to determine 
whether they are likely to be vulnerable. 

There are effective countermeasures against our attacks and we have 
worked with a number of TLS and DTLS software developers to prepare 
patches and security advisories.

			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p>
			The team behind this research comprises Nadhem AlFardan and <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/%7Ekp">
Kenny Paterson</a>. Nadhem is a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/">Information Security Group</a> at <a href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway, University of London</a>.
 Kenny is a Professor of Information Security and an EPSRC Leadership 
Fellow in the Information Security Group. We have previous experience in
 analysing secure network protocols, including IPsec, SSH, SSL/TLS and 
DTLS.
			</p>
			
			<a name="Version"></a>
			<h2>What is affected?</h2>
			<h3>Which versions of TLS and DTLS are affected?</h3>
			<p>The attacks apply to all TLS and DTLS implementations that are 
compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2. They also apply 
to implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate 
countermeasures to previous padding oracle attacks. Variant attacks may 
also apply to non-compliant implementations. </p>
			
			<h3>Which TLS and DTLS ciphersuites are affected?</h3>
			<p>All TLS and DTLS ciphersuites which include CBC-mode encryption are potentially vulnerable to our attacks.</p>
			
			<h3>Which TLS and DTLS implementations are affected?</h3>
			<p>We have tested our attacks against OpenSSL and GnuTLS. For 
OpenSSL, a full plaintext recovery attack is possible. For GnuTLS, a 
partial plaintext recovery attack is possible, recovering up to 4 bits 
of the last byte in any block of plaintext. We have examined the source 
code of the NSS, PolarSSL, yaSSL, BouncyCastle and OpenJDK 
implementations of TLS. They are all potentially vulnerable to our 
attacks. We have not studied any closed-source implementations of TLS.
</p>
			
			<a name="TLSseverity"></a>
			<h2>How severe are the attacks?</h2>
			<p>We have discovered a variety of attacks, each having different 
complexity and severity. For TLS, our attacks are multi-session attacks,
 which means that we require the target plaintext to be repeatedly sent 
in the same position in the plaintext stream in multiple TLS sessions. 
The attacks involve detecting small differences in the time at which TLS
 error messages appear on the network in response to attacker-generated 
ciphertexts. Because of network jitter and other effects, the times 
observed by the attacker are noisy, and multiple samples of each time 
are needed to make the attacks reliable. 

In their simplest form, our attacks can reliably recover a complete 
block of TLS-encrypted plaintext using about 2<sup>23</sup> TLS 
sessions, assuming the attacker is located on the same LAN as the 
machine being attacked and HMAC-SHA1 is used as TLS's MAC algorithm. 
This can be reduced to 2<sup>19</sup> TLS sessions if the plaintext is known to be base64 encoded. This can be further reduced to 2<sup>13</sup>
 sessions per byte if a byte of plaintext in one of the last two 
positions in a block is already known. The attack complexities are 
different for different MAC algorithms. Further details can be found in 
our  <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>.</p>

<p>The sessions needed for our attacks on TLS can be generated in 
various ways. The attacks cause the TLS session to be terminated, and 
some applications running over TLS automatically reconnect and 
retransmit a cookie or password. In a web environment, the sessions may 
also be generated by client-side malware, in a similar way to the BEAST 
attack. Unlike BEAST, no exploit is needed to bypass the same origin 
policy in the web browser, since the attacker does not require the 
ability to inject plaintext blocks into the TLS session. And, with the 
BEAST-style enhancements, the attacker no longer needs to know one out 
of two bytes of plaintext at the end of the block, so that full 
plaintext recovery of the full base64 encoded plaintext is possible 
using 2<sup>13</sup> sessions per byte.</p>

<p>For DTLS, the attacks can be carried out in a single session, and 
known amplification techniques can be used to boost the timing signals 
relative to the noise. (Further details of these techniques can be found
 in <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/%7Ekp/dtls.pdf">our NDSS12 paper</a>.) The attacks are fully practical for DTLS. For further details, see the <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>.
</p>
			
			<a name="Knownresults"></a>
			<h2>	How does this work relate to known attacks, like BEAST and CRIME?</h2>
			<p>TLS in CBC-mode has been the subject of several attacks over the 
years, most notably padding oracle attacks and the BEAST attack. For 
more details of prior attacks, see our  <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>.
 However, there are countermeasures for both of these attacks, and TLS 
in CBC-mode was believed to be secure once these countermeasures were 
applied. Our research shows that this is not the case. In particular, 
the advice to implementors in the TLS RFCs concerning how to avoid 
padding oracle attacks does not remove all possible timing side 
channels. 
</p>

			<h3>Wasn't TLS in CBC-mode recently proven to be secure?</h3>

			<p>Yes, a recent <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/%7Ekp/mee-comp.pdf">paper</a>
 of Paterson, Ristenpart and Shrimpton (Asiacrypt 2011) showed that the 
TLS Record Protocol meets a strong notion of cryptographic security, but
 their proof holds under the assumption that an attacker cannot discern 
the cause of TLS decryption failures. Our new research shows that this 
assumption is not met by TLS implementations, even when they follow the 
implementation advice in the TLS RFCs.</p>
			
			<h3>How do the attacks relate to BEAST and CRIME?</h3>

			<p>The attacks are quite different from BEAST and CRIME. BEAST 
exploits the inadvisable use of chained IVs in CBC-mode in SSL and TLS 
1.0. CRIME cleverly exploits the use of compression in TLS. Our attacks 
are based on analysing how decryption processing is carried out in TLS. 
However, our attacks can be enhanced by combining them with BEAST-style 
techniques.</p>


			<h3>How do the attacks relate to padding oracle attacks?</h3>
			<p>At a high level, the attacks can be seen as an advanced form of 
padding oracle attack. In more detail, the attacks rely on the fact 
that, for certain carefully chosen message lengths and when the 
HMAC-SHA1 MAC algorithm is used, then TLS messages containing at least 
two bytes of correct padding will be processed slightly faster than TLS 
messages containing one byte of correct padding or padding that is 
incorrectly formatted. This is because of a fortuitous alignment of TLS 
header bytes, plaintext bytes and MAC tag bytes with the block cipher's 
block boundary and the hash compression function's block boundary. The 
timing difference corresponds to the time taken for a single hash 
function compression function evaluation, on the order of a few hundred 
clock cycles on a modern processor. This timing difference is detected 
over the network in our attack, by timing the arrival of TLS error 
messages. By repeating the attack sufficiently often and using careful 
statistical processing, the noise arising from network jitter and other 
sources can be overcome and the different padding conditions can be 
differentiated from one another. Thus an attacker can distinguish 
messages containing at least two bytes of correct padding from all other
 patterns. At this point, a variant of the standard padding oracle 
attack can be carried out. For further details, please see our  <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>.</p>

			
			<a name="Name"></a>
			<h2>Why are the attacks called "Lucky Thirteen"?</h2>
			<p>In Western culture, 13 is considered an unlucky number. However, 
the fact that the TLS MAC calculation includes 13 bytes of header 
information (5 bytes of TLS header plus 8 bytes of TLS sequence number) 
is, in part, what makes the attacks possible. So, in the context of our 
attacks, 13 is lucky - from the attacker's perspective at least. This is
 what passes for humour amongst cryptographers. </p>
					
			<a name="Countermeasures"></a>
			<h2>What are the countermeasures?</h2>
			<p>There are several possible countermeasures against our attacks, some of which are more effective than others:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Add random time delays to CBC-mode decryption processing.</b> As we explain in more detail in our <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>, this is ineffective, since the effect of the delays can be averaged out by taking more timing samples.</li>

			<li><b>Switch to using RC4 ciphersuites.</b> This should only be seen
 as a temporary measure, since RC4 has significant cryptographic 
weaknesses when it is used in TLS. This option is not available for 
DTLS.</li>
	 
	 		<li><b>Switch to using AEAD ciphersuites, such as AES-GCM.</b> 
Support for AEAD ciphersuites was specified in TLS 1.2, but this version
 of TLS is not yet widely supported. We hope that our research will spur
 support for TLS 1.2 in client and server implementations. </li>
			
			<li><b>Modify TLS's CBC-mode decryption procedure so as to remove the timing side channel</b> Our  <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf">research paper</a>
 describes one method for doing this that is being adopted by some 
vendors. Other approaches are also possible. However, some care is 
needed in implementations to completely remove the timing side channel 
that our attacks exploit. Our recommendation for the long term is to 
avoid using TLS in CBC-mode and to switch to using AEAD algorithms.</li></ul>
			
			<a name="Patches"></a>

			<h2>Is it still safe to use TLS?</h2>
			<p>The attacks can only be carried out by a determined attacker who 
is located close to the machine being attacked and who can generate 
sufficient sessions for the attacks. In this sense, the attacks do not 
pose a significant danger to ordinary users of TLS in their current 
form. However, it is a truism that attacks only get better with time, 
and we cannot anticipate what improvements to our attacks, or entirely 
new attacks, may yet to be discovered. In addition, because of its 
extremely widespread use, any attack against TLS requires careful 
evaluation. In this context, it is notable that the leading TLS 
implementations are deploying countermeasures to our attacks. </p>
			

			<a name="Source"></a>
			<h2>Source code</h2>
			<p>We have no plans to make the source code generally available. If 
you are a researcher interested in replicating or extending our work, 
then please contact us.</p>

			<a name="Disclosure"></a>
			<h2>Isn't it irresponsible to publish attacks on such important protocols?</h2>
			
			<p>In short, no. Our long-term aim is to ensure that weak encryption 
options are eliminated from TLS, to the eventual benefit of all users of
 TLS. Experience shows that the only way to make this happen is to make 
the attacks as powerful as possible and build proof-of-concept 
implementations of them. We have expended significant research effort to
 develop and prototype our attacks. We disclosed the attacks to affected
 vendors well in advance of making our research public, and we worked 
with any vendor who requested our assistance in assessing the attacks 
and implementing countermeasures.</p>
