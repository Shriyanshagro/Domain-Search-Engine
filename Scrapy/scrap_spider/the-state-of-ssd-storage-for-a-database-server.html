<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2009/10/27/the-state-of-ssd-storage-for-a-database-server/'>The state of SSD storage for a database server</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 27 October 2009</p>
<p>Note: The SSD market is moving quickly, so I'm sure by the time you read
this, it's probably out of date :)</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/2009/10/19/ibm-x3550-m2-or-x3650-m2-and-debianubuntu/">another
post</a>,
we're looking for some new servers. These are to replace our existing
database servers, which have had a long and productive life (over 6
years). They're still running fine, but they're starting to get a little
more loaded than we'd like during backup runs. As an FYI, our database
requirements are much smaller than you'd expect for our size. Our
database holds information like the user list, domains, aliases, user
address book, personalities, signatures, etc, but most of our storage
space is used by emails and files, and those aren't stored in the
database at all. Because of that, we only need about 20G of storage now.</p>

<p>I'd really like to get some machines that will last at least 3 years,
and scale to at least 20x what the existing servers can. To do that, I
think we need to look at using SSD technology for storage. Unfortunately
the SSD storage market currently presents a whole range of choices, all
with their own annoying pros and cons. For the 20x scale, I'm looking at
about 200-400G of storage. Looking over them I've found these.</p>

<h4>Intel X-25e</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/extreme/index.htm">http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/extreme/index.htm</a></li>
<li>SATA interface, so doesn't need a separate driver</li>
<li>Cheap (~$800 for 64G = $12.50/G). At that price, you can get a
couple and RAID10 them fairly easily though, and doubling the
price/G still leaves it the cheapest</li>
<li>Slow compared to other SSD solutions (1000's IOPS rather than
10,000's or 100,000's)</li>
<li>Questions about performance when you disable write cache, put them
in a RAID array, and do lots of writes over time. Some initial
analysis here: <a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=518">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=518</a>,
<a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=532">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=532</a>,

<a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=557">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=557</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Fusion-IO</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fusionio.com/Products.aspx">http://www.fusionio.com/Products.aspx</a></li>
<li>PCI-e interface, needs a driver for Linux that previously was of
questionable quality
(<a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2008-07/msg00010.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2008-07/msg00010.php</a>),
I haven't seen any recent user reports about use and stability, so I
don't know where it's at for production use</li>
<li>Reasonably expensive (~$3000 for 80G = $37.5/G)</li>
<li>In theory fast. Data sheet claims "IOPS 89,549 (75/25 r/w mix 4k
packet size)" for 80G version. But when used in actual database
system, increase over SAS RAID systems is only about 400% maximum
(<a href="http://www.kennygorman.com/wordpress/?p=398">http://www.kennygorman.com/wordpress/?p=398</a>,

<li>There's also questions about the durability of storage, or the
performance if you enable durable mode
(<a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/03/02/ssd-xfs-lvm-fsync-write-cache-barrier-and-lost-transactions/">http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/03/02/ssd-xfs-lvm-fsync-write-cache-barrier-and-lost-transactions/</a>,

</ul>

<h4>RamSan-10/20</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ramsan.com/products/ramsan-20.htm">http://www.ramsan.com/products/ramsan-20.htm</a></li>
<li>PCI-e interface, there's only a binary only driver for RH/SUSE at
the moment, but apparently they're working on an open source driver</li>
<li>Reasonably expensive (~$20,000 for 450G = $44/G, I'm guessing the
225G is about half that)</li>
<li>In theory fast. Claims "120,000 sustained IOPS", but I haven't seen
anyone use them in a database benchmark</li>
<li>The RamSan and Fusion IO superficially appear very similar.
According to TMS, here's some claimed benefits over Fusion-IO.
<ol>
<li>CPU and memory resources - Fusion-IO uses system CPU + RAM for
flash management (up to 30-40% CPU + 5.5G RAM per 80G of flash),
RamSan has onboard CPU + DRAM. "The RamSan-20 has an onboard
processor and four FPGA controllers while the cards from Fusion
use the server’s processor and memory to run and manage the
card. The write management software that we have programmed into
the RamSan-20 is far superior to the write management software
on the cards from Fusion I/O. This is why our sustained
performance is dramatically better"</li>
<li>All SLC. Higher capacity Fusion-IO devices use MLC, which is
slower and has lower lifetime</li>
<li>Claim Fusion-IO IOPS are "burst" numbers, while theirs are
"sustained"</li>
<li>Super Capacitors - are battery back-ups on the RamSan-20 that
provide enough power to shut down the card gracefully in the
event of an unmanaged server shutdown. Fusion's card does not
have Supercaps. Data is not lost but the recovery time is
incredibly long. After the server is rebooted, the Fusion card
needs to rebuild their index tables showing where the data is
located. The RamSan-20 data is immediately available after the
server reboot, the Fusion card will take about 10 minutes to
reload</li>
</ol></li>
<li>There's some benchmarks of a RamSan-500 (external flash based unit)
here: <a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=139">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=139</a>,
<a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=140">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=140</a>,
<a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=141">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=141</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Sun F5100</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/sss/f5100/">http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/sss/f5100/</a></li>
<li>Multiple SAS interfaces, so doesn't need a separate driver</li>
<li>Separate 1U rack mount box</li>
<li>Very expensive (~$45,000 for 480G = $93.75/G)</li>
<li>Fast, and the massive 2T system claims >1.6M IOPS</li>
<li>Seems a nice idea, but with a minimum price of $45k for one box, you
need to be able to justify the amount and cost of that storage. For
larger database users, this might be really interesting to try out</li>
</ul>

<h4>Violin Memory</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.violin-memory.com/">http://www.violin-memory.com/</a></li>
<li>Multiple interfaces is seems: "Fibre Channel and Ethernet network
attachments are supported via a network head and direct attachment
through a low latency PCI Express (PCIe) connection. Operating
systems supported via an open source PCIe driver include: Major
Linux releases and distributions, Windows 32 and 64-bit Operating
Systems, OpenSolaris"</li>
<li>I can't find price information anywhere, I'm guessing it's "if you
have to ask, you can't afford it" school of products? With up to 4TB
support, it seems it's aiming for a particularly high end market
compared to what we're looking for (100+G of storage)</li>
<li>Very fast. Interesting that you can choose between DRAM or Flash
memory to vary performance/durability
(<a href="http://violin-memory.com/Memory_Flexibility">http://violin-memory.com/Memory_Flexibility</a>). But if you go DRAM,
you need to be extra careful about power, because if power goes, you
lose it all.</li>
<li>There's some benchmarks here: <a href="http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=334">http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=334</a></li>
</ul>

<h4> </h4>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>There doesn't appear to be a clear "winning" solution, as usual, it
depends on your storage, IO, and cost requirements. When I first heard
about Fusion IO, I was initially very excited about what it seemed to
offer, but over time, I've become a bit more circumspect given the
concerns over durability, system overhead (RAM + CPU), and recovery time
requirements. The Sun and Violin options seem designed at considerably
higher end (both storage space and cost) systems than what we're looking
for. I really wish the RamSan-10/20 had an open source Linux driver.
Given TMS have a long history with NVRAM systems, I have a gut feeling
of "they know what they're doing", but for us, an open source driver is
mandatory. That really just leaves Intel drives in a RAID array at the
moment, which is probably what we'll aim for now. By starting with just
2 drives now (very cheap), we can at least replace them in the future
with either more, or newer and faster drives, or another solution
altogether if it comes along.</p>
