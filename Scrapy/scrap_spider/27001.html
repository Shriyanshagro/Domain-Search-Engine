      <p> ISO/IEC 27001:2013 instructs you how to build, operate, maintain and improve an ISMS. It is based on the new standard structure for all management systems standards, which is gradually being adopted in other areas such as quality and environmental management. It requires you to select security controls based upon risk assessment, and to consider all the controls defined in ISO/IEC 27002, the Code of Practice. The list is not exhaustive and you are free to identify additional control objectives and controls as you please.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <p><a name="Code of Practice" class="H2" id="Code of Practice">The Code of Practice</a></p>
      <p>ISO/IEC 27002:2013 defines 114 security controls structured
        under 14 major headings to enable readers to identify the
        particular safeguards that are appropriate to their
        particular business or specific area of responsibility.
        These security controls contain further detailed advice
        resulting in somewhere in the region of 5000 elements of best practice.</p>
      
      <hr />
      <p><a name="certification" class="H2" id="certification">Certification schemes</a></p>
      <p>Certification schemes have been established in many parts of the
        world.</p>
      <p>ISO/IEC 27006 provides guidance
        to National Accreditation Bodies for the accreditation of
        Certification Bodies wishing to assess ISMSs, e.g. against
        ISO/IEC 27001:2013.&nbsp; The various National Accreditation Bodies around
        the world operate a &#8220;mutual recognition&#8221; process that allows
        certificates awarded in one country to be accepted by the
        Accreditation Body of another.</p>
      <p>In order to be awarded a certificate, your ISMS will
        be audited by an ISMS <em>assessor</em>. The assessor
        cannot also be a consultant. There are very strict rules
        about this. The assessor will work for a <em>Certification
          Body</em> (such as BSI Assessment Services Limited and Det Norske
        Veritas).</p>
      <p>The Certification Body will award you the certificate.
        The certificate will document the scope of your ISMS and other relevant details, such as the statement of applicability. Only
        Certification Bodies that have been duly accredited by a National Accreditation Body can issue
        certificates.</p>
      <p>The assessor will return periodically to check that
        your ISMS is working as intended.</p>
