    <h1><a id="sec-introduction" name="sec-introduction">1 Introduction to SWSL and SWSO</a></h1>

    <p>
      The promise of Web services and the need for widely accepted standards
      enabling them are widely recognized, and considerable efforts are
      underway to define and evolve such standards in the commercial realm. In
      particular, the Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
      [<cite><a href="#WSDL">WSDL 1.1</a></cite>] 
      is
      already well established as an essential building block in the evolving
      stack of Web service technologies, and is being standardized in the W3C's
      Web Services Description Working Group. WSDL, in essence, allows
      for the specification of the syntax of the input and output messages of a
      basic service, as well as other details needed for the invocation of the
      service. WSDL does not, however, support the specification of workflows
      composed of basic services. In this area, the Business Process Execution
      Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) 
      [<cite><a href="#BPEL">BPEL 1.1</a></cite>], 
      under development at OASIS,
      has the most prominent status. The Choreography Description Language
      under development by W3C's Web Services Choreography Working
      Group, serves to "define from a global viewpoint ...  the
      information exchanges that occur and the jointly agreed ordering rules
      that need to be satisfied" in carrying out a Web service-based
      transaction 
            [<cite><a href="#WS-Choreography">WS-Choreography</a></cite>].
      With respect to registering Web services for
      purposes of advertising and discovery, Universal Description, Discovery
      and Integration (UDDI) [<cite><a
      href="#UDDI">UDDI v3.02</a></cite>] has received the most attention to
      date. Standards are also being developed in connection with various other
      aspects of Web service provisioning, such as reliable messaging,
      security, and resource management.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, recognition is growing of the need for richer semantic
      specifications of Web services, based on a compressive representational
      framework that spans the full range of service-related concepts. Such a
      framework will enable fuller, more flexible automation of service
      provision and use, support the construction of more powerful tools and
      methodologies, and promote the use of semantically well-founded reasoning
      about services. Because an expressive representation framework permits
      the specification of many different aspects of services, it can provide a
      foundation for a broad range of activities, across the Web service
      lifecycle. For example, richer semantics can support greater automation
      of service selection and invocation; automated translation of message
      content between heterogeneous interoperating services; automated or
      semi-automated approaches to service composition; more comprehensive
      approaches to service monitoring and recovery from failure; and fuller
      automation of verification, simulation, configuration, supply chain
      management, contracting, and negotiation for services.  
      The technologies presented in this document are designed to 
      realize this <em>Semantic Web Service</em> vision
      [<cite><a href="#McIlraith01">McIlraith01</a></cite>].
    </p>
    <p>
      This report presents 
      two major components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/Submission/2005/SUBM-SWSF-SWSL-20050909/">
	  <b>Semantic Web Services Language (SWSL)</b></a> is used to
	specify formal characterizations of Web service concepts and
	descriptions of individual services.  It includes two
	sublanguages.
        <b><i>SWSL-FOL</i></b> is based on first-order logic (FOL) and is used
        primarily to express the formal characterization (ontology) of
        Web service concepts.
	<b><i>SWSL-Rules</i></b> is based on the logic-programming (or "rules")
        paradigm and is used to support the use of the service ontology in
        reasoning and execution environments based on that paradigm.
        SWSL is a general-purpose language (that is, its features are
        not service-specific), but it has been designed to address the needs of
        Semantic Web Services.  Also associated with SWSL is a
	<em>simplified presentation syntax</em>, which reduces to SWSL-FOL.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <a
	   href="/Submission/2005/SUBM-SWSF-SWSO-20050909/">
	  <b>Semantic Web Services Ontology (SWSO)</b></a> presents a
        conceptual model by which Web services can be described, and an
        axiomatization, or formal characterization, of that model.
        The complete axiomatization is given in first-order logic, using
        SWSL-FOL, with a model-theoretic semantics that specifies the
        precise <i>meaning</i> of the concepts. We call this FOL form of the ontology <em><b>FLOWS</b></em> --
	<b>F</b>irst-Order <b>L</b>ogic <b>O</b>ntology for <b>
	  W</b>eb <b>S</b>ervices.  In addition, the axioms from FLOWS have been
	  systematically translated into the SWSL-Rules language (with an
	  unavoidable weakening of some axioms). The resulting
	  ontology, which relies on logic-programming semantics,
	  is called
	<em><b>ROWS</b></em> -- <b>R</b>ules <b>O</b>ntology for <b>
	  W</b>eb <b>S</b>ervices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      More specifically, SWSL is a general-purpose logical language,
      with certain features to make it usable with the basic languages and
      infrastructure of the Web. These features include URIs, integration of
      XML built-in types, and XML-compatible namespace and import
      mechanisms. SWSL includes two layers of expressiveness: SWSL-FOL
      and SWSL-Rules. SWSL-FOL is a first-order logic, extended with features
      from HiLog
      [<cite><a
      href="#hilog">Chen93</a></cite>]
      and the frame syntax of F-logic
      [<cite><a
      href="#f-logic">Kifer95</a></cite>].
      SWSL-Rules is a full-featured logic programming (LP) language, which
      includes a novel combination of features from Courteous logic programs
      [<cite><a
      href="#Grosof99a">Grosof99a</a></cite>],
      HiLog, and F-logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the elements of
      the syntax are
      common to both SWSL-FOL and SWSL-Rules, so as to promote the ability of
      developers to easily work with both layers, and to facilitate various
      kinds of interchange and interoperation between the layers. The
      presentation syntax is designed for readability, and incorporates a
      number of convenience features, such as an object-oriented style of
      presentation, which can be used to improve code organization and
      comprehensibility, but without changing the expressiveness and
      tractability of the underlying logical systems. An XML-based
      serialization syntax, based on RuleML, is also specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLOWS is an axiomatized ontology of service concepts,
      which provides the conceptual framework for describing and reasoning
      about services. FLOWS draws many of its intuitions and lessons-learned
      from OWL-S, the OWL ontology for Web services
      [<cite><a href="#OWL-S-white-paper">OWL-S 1.1</a></cite>].  A key
      contribution of the FLOWS ontology is the development of a rich
      behavioural process model, based on ISO 18629
      <a href="http://www.mel.nist.gov/psl/">
	Process Specification Language </a> (PSL)
      [<cite><a href="#PSL1-Gruninger">Gruninger03a</a></cite>],
      [<cite><a href="#PSL2-Gruninger">Gruninger03b</a></cite>].
      Originally designed to support interoperability among process modeling
      languages, PSL provides the ideal foundation for interoperability among
      emerging Web service process models, while supporting the realization of
      automation task associated with the Semantic Web Service vision. FLOWS
      goes beyond PSL in modeling many Web-service specific process concepts
      including messages, channels, inputs and outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLOWS is
      designed modularly.  It comprises an ontology for service descriptors,
      somewhat akin to a domain-independent yellow-pages or OWL-S service
      profile, an extensive process model ontology, and a grounding that
      relates the process model message types to WSDL messages.  
      The process model ontology is in
      turn comprised of a core ontology and a number of extensions.  
      </p>

    <p>The statements above about FLOWS are also true of ROWS, which
    is derived from FLOWS.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to presenting SWSL and SWSO, this document also
      provides some guidance as to how SWSL-FOL and SWSL-Rules can be
      used together, examples of applications of SWSL and SWSO, and a
      discussion of how FLOWS-based service descriptions can be
      <em>grounded</em> in the concrete descriptions of messages and
      protocols provided by WSDL.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal has been prepared by the 
      <a
      href="http://www.daml.org/services/swsl/">Semantic Web Services
      Language Committee</a> of the <a
      href="http://www.swsi.org">Semantic Web Services Initiative</a>,
      a collaborative
      international research effort. In addition to providing further
      evolution of the SWSL language and ontology, SWSI will also be a forum for
      working towards convergence of SWSL with the products
      of the WSMO research effort
      [<cite><a href="#wsmo-d2">Bruijn05</a></cite>].
    </p>

    <p>
      The overall design of the SWSL Language and Ontology, and of the
      application scenarios using those, has been motivated by an
      overall longer-term vision and set of objectives for Semantic
      Web services.  These are summarized in a requirements document,
      which is available on the SWSL Committee's Web site [<cite><a
      href="#SWSL-Req">SWSL Requirements</a></cite>].  That document
      expressed our thinking as we set out to design the SWSF Languge
      and Ontology.  The current design of SWSF addresses, directly or
      indirectly, most (but not all) of the points in the requirements
      document.

    </p>
    <h2 id="Related_Efforts">Related Efforts</h2>
    <p>
      <em><b>OWL-S</b></em>: OWL-S 
      [<cite><a href="#OWL-S-white-paper">OWL-S 1.1</a></cite>] 
      is an ontology of service concepts expressed
      in OWL-DL, a decidable description logic language.  
      In contrast, FLOWS is an ontology of service concepts 
      expressed in first-order logic.  Since OWL-DL trades off expressiveness
      for decidability, there were aspects of the OWL-S process model 
      ontology whose semantics could not be defined in the OWL-DL language.
      This is not a problem with the FLOWS ontology.  FLOWS provides a
      more comprehensive ontology, building on the conceptual model and
      lessons-learned from OWL-S.  As such it captures all
      concepts in OWL-S.  In terms of coverage it is distinguished by 
      its axiomatization of messages, something that was not addressed in 
      OWL-S.  An important final distinction between OWL-S and FLOWS is
      with respect to the role it plays.  Whereas both endeavours attempt
      to provide an ontology for Web services, FLOWS had the additional
      objective of acting as a focal point for interoperability, enabling
      other business process modeling languages to be expressed or
      related to FLOWS. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><b>Process Specification Language (PSL) and related
	  specifications</b></em>: There are a number of efforts whose aim is
	  to develop a process specification ontology. These efforts include
	  PSL [<cite><a href="#PSL1-Gruninger">Gruninger03a</a></cite>], BPMI
	  [<cite><a href="#BPML">BPML 1.0</a></cite>], and others. The process
	  ontology of SWSL is based on PSL. From the perspective of PSL, FLOWS
	  may be viewed as a collection of extensions that situate the
	  description of processes within a larger context of message-based
	  communications across networks. </p>
    <p>
      <em><b>BPEL4WS</b></em>:   There is much to be said about the 
       relationship between this effort and BPEL4WS
         [<cite><a href="#BPEL">BPEL 1.1</a></cite>].  
       BPEL4WS provides an executable
       business process modeling language that enables the specification
       (orchestration) of executable business processes as well as the
       description of non-executable processes.  The most obvious point of
       comparison between BPEL4WS and this effort is with respect to the
       FLOWS ontology.  The FLOWS ontology is a great deal more than process
       modeling, supporting the axiomatization of non-functional service 
       descriptions (for service discovery) as well as the rich mapping of 
       message types to WSDL.
       We believe that the FLOWS process model subsumes the BPEL4WS process
       model, enabling the encoding of both executable and abstract BPEL 
       process models in FLOWS.  (Note
       that we have not yet confirmed this through a systematic translation.)
       Whereas BPEL takes a message-centric view of services, FLOWS provides
       for a process-centric view of services, where message exchanges
       are conceived as additional processes that may be inferred automatically.       A notable difference between the two formalisms is that FLOWS supports
       the encoding of service side-effects, i.e., the effects of services
       on the world, which enables automated composition of Web services,
       in additon to the manual composition supported by BPEL.
       Finally, 
       BPEL is indeed designed for Web service orchestration, whereas
       FLOWS may also be used for choreography of services.
 
    </p>


    <p>
      <em><b>Web Services Modeling Ontology (WSMO)</b></em>: WSMO [<cite><a
      href="#wsmo-d2">Bruijn05</a></cite>] is a
      parallel effort to define an ontology and a language for Semantic Web
      services. Like SWSL-Rules, WSMO's rule language, WSML is largely based on
      F-logic and these languages share much of the logical expression
      syntax. Nevertheless, the two groups have pursued complimentary
      goals. WSMO has focused heavily on the language effort, and in particular
      on end user issues, associated with the language.  In particular, they
      have developed a "conceptual syntax" for top-level descriptions of
      services, which might make the specifications easier to read for the end
      user. WSMO has also paid special attention to the issue of OWL
      compatibility. To this end, it defined WSML-Core as a subset of both OWL
      and WSML, which serves as a common ground for ontology
      interoperability. In contrast, SWSL's focus was on extending the
      functionality of the rule language. In particular, SWSL-Rules supports
      meta-reasoning with its HiLog and reification extensions. It also
      supports prioritized defaults and classical negation by incorporating
      Courteous Logic Programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major distinction between the WSMO effort and the effort presented here
      is with respect to the ontology.  The two efforts are divergent, but
      complementary.  WSMO has focussed on describing Web service choreography
      through guarded transition rules, Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules
      which are viewed as abstract
      state machines. In contrast, FLOWS provides an extensive first-order
      process ontology, which enables description of process orchestration as
      well as message exchange among processes. The FLOWS ontology also
      provides the foundation for enabling automated simulation, verification
      and composition of Web services, something that cannot be done with the
      guarded transition rules, without further definition of the semantics.

      includes a glossary and references.  For simplicity, these are
      the same in each document.
      </p>
    <p>
      For pedagogical reasons, it makes sense to introduce SWSL before
      SWSO, since SWSL is used in expressing SWSO.  However, the SWSO
      document relies primarily on simple uses of SWSL-FOL.  Hence,
      those readers who are already familiar with first-order logic
      may want to begin with the SWSO document, which contains the Web
      services-specific aspects of this work.  A suggested order of
      reading for such readers is: the Overview document (this
      document); the Ontology document; the first two sections of the
      Applications document; the Language document; the three
      remaining sections of the Applications document.

      <h1><a id="sec-glossary" name="sec-glossary">4  Glossary</a></h1>
      
<dl>

  <dt><a name="gl-Activity"><b>Activity</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Activity</em>.  
      In the formal PSL ontology, the notion of activity is a basic construct,
      which corresponds intuitively to a kind of (manufacturing
      or processing) activity.  
      In PSL, an activity may have associated
      <em>occurrences</em>, which 
      correspond intuitively to individual instances or 
      executions of the activity.
      (We note that in PSL an activity is not a class or type with
      occurrences as members; rather, an activity is an object,
      and occurrences are related to this object by the
      binary predicate <code>occurrence_of</code>.) 
      The occurrences of an activity may impact 
      fluents (which provide an abstract
      representation of the "real world").
      In FLOWS, with each service there is an associated
      activity (called the "service activity" of that service).
      The service activity may specify aspects of the internal
      process flow of the service, and also aspects of the
      messaging interface of that service to other services.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-Channel"><b>Channel</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Channel</em>.  
      In FLOWS, a channel is a formal conceptual object, 
      which corresponds intuitively to a repository and
      conduit for messages.
      The FLOWS notion of channel is quite primitive,
      and under various restrictions can be used to model
      the form of channel or message-passing as 
      found in web services standards,
      including WSDL, BPEL, WS-Choreography, WSMO,
      and also as found in several research investigations,
      including process algrebras.
  </dd>    


  <dt><a name="gl-FLOWS"><b>FLOWS</b></a></dt>
   <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em><b>F</b>irst-order 
     <b>L</b>ogic <b>O</b>ntology for <b>W</b>eb <b>S</b>ervices</em>.  
     FLOWS, also known as SWSO-FOL, 
     is the first-order logic version of the Semantic Web Services Ontology.
     FLOWS is an extension of the PSL-OuterCore ontology, to 
     incorporate the fundamental aspects of 
     (web and other electronic) services, including service descriptors,
     the service activity, and the service grounding.
   </dd>



  <dt><a name="gl-fluent"><b>Fluent</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Fluent</em>.  
      In FLOWS, following PSL and the situation calculii, a
      fluent is a first-order logic term or predicate whose
      value may vary over time.
      In a first-order model of a FLOWS theory, this 
      being a model of PSL-OuterCore,
      time is represented as a discrete linear sequence
      of <em>timees</em>, and
      fluents has a value for each time in this sequence.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-grounding"><b>Grounding</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Grounding</em>.  
      The SWSO concepts for describing service activities,
      and the instantiations
      of these concepts that describe a particular service activity, are
      <i>abstract</i> specifications, in the sense that they do not specify
      the details of particular message formats, transport protocols, 
      and network
      addresses by which a Web service is accessed. The role of
      the <i>grounding</i> is to provide these more concrete
      details.
      A substantial portion of the grounding can be acheived by
      mapping SWSO concepts into corresponding WSDL constructs.
      (Additional grounding, e.g., of some process-related aspects
      of SWSO, might be acheived using other standards, such
      as BPEL.)
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-Message"><b>Message</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Message</em>.  
      In FLOWS, a message is a formal conceptual object, 
      which corresponds intuitively to a single message that
      is created by a service occurrence, and read by zero
      or more service occurrences.
      The FLOWS notion of message is quite primitive, and
      under various restrictions can be used to model
      the form of messages as found in web services standards,
      including WSDL (1.0 and 2.0), BPEL, WS-Choreography, WSMO,
      and also as found in several research investigations.
      A message has a <em>payload</em>, which corresponds 
      intuitively to the body or contents of the message.
      In FLOWS emphasis is placed on the knowledge that
      is gained by a service occurrence when reading a message
      with a given payload
      (and the knowledge needed to create that message.
  </dd>    

  <dt><a name="gl-Occurrence"><b>Occurrence</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Occurence (of a service)</em>.  
      In FLOWS, a service <em>S</em> has an associated FLOWS activity 
      <em>A</em> (which
      generalizes the notion of PSL activity).
      An <em>occurrence</em> of <em>S</em> is formally
      a PSL occurrence of the activity <em>A</em>.
      Intuitively, this occurrence corresponds to
      an instance or execution (from start to finish) of the activity
      <em>A</em>, i.e., of the process associated with
      service <em>S</em>.
      As in PSL, an occurrence has a starting time
      time and an ending time.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-PSL"><b>PSL</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Process Specification Language</em>.  
      The Process Specification Language (PSL) is a
      formally axiomatized ontology 
      [<cite><a href="#PSL1-Gruninger">Gruninger03a</a></cite>, 
       <cite><a href="#PSL2-Gruninger">Gruninger03b</a></cite>] 
      that has been
      standardized as ISO 18629.  
      PSL provides a layered, extensible ontology
      for specifying properties of processes. 
      The most basic PSL constructs are embodied in
      PSL-Core; and PSL-OuterCore incorporates 
      several extensions of PSL-Core that includes
      several useful constructs.  
      (An overview of concepts in PSL
      that are
      relevant to FLOWS is given in 
      <a href="/Submission/2005/SUBM-SWSF-SWSO-20050909/#onto-background">Section 6 of the 
      Semantic Web Services Ontology document</a>.)
  </dd>    

  <dt><a name="gl-qname"><b>QName</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Qualified name</em>.  
     A pair (<em>URI</em>, <em>local-name</em>). The <em>URI</em> represents a
     namespace and <em>local-name</em> represents a name used in an XML
     document, such as a tag name or an attribute name.
    In XML, QNames are syntactically
    represented as <em>prefix</em>:<em>local-name</em>, where <em>prefix</em> is
     a macro that expands into a concrete URI.
    See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/">Namespaces
     in XML</a> for more details.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-ROWS"><b>ROWS</b></a></dt>
   <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em><b>R</b>ules <b>O</b>ntology for <b>W</b>eb <b>S</b>ervices</em>.  
     ROWS, also known as SWSO-Rules, 
     is the rules-based version of the Semantic Web Services Ontology.
     ROWS is created by a relatively straight-forward,
     almost faithful,
     transformation of FLOWS, the First-order Logic Ontology for
     Web Services.
     As with FLOWS, ROWS incorporates
     fundamental aspects of 
     (web and other electronic) services, including service descriptors,
     the service activity, and the service grounding.
     ROWS enables a rules-based specification of a family of
     services, including both the underlying ontology and
     the domain-specific aspects.
   </dd>



  <dt><a name="gl-service"><b>Service</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>(Formal) Service</em>.  
     In FLOWS, a service is a conceptual object, that
     corresponds intuitively to a web service (or other electronically
     accessible service).  Through binary predicates a service
     is associated with various service descriptors (a.k.a. 
     non-functional properties) such as Service Name, Service Author, 
     Service URL, etc.; an <em>activity</em> (in the sense of
     PSL) which specifies intuitively the process model associated with the
     service; and a <em>grounding</em>.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-contract"><b>Service contract</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Describes an agreement between the service requester and service 
  provider, 
  detailing requirements on a service occurrence or family of
  service occurrences.
</dd>


  <dt><a name="gl-service-descriptor"><b>Service descriptor</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    <em>Service Descriptor</em>.  
     This is one of several non-functional properties 
     associated with services.
     The Service Descriptors include
     Service Name, Service Author, Service Contract Information,
     Service Contributor, Service Description, Service URL,
     Service Identifier, Service Version, Service Release Date, 
     Service Language, Service Trust, Service Subject, 
     Service Reliability, and Service Cost.
  </dd>    


  <dt><a name="gl-serv-offer"><b>Service offer description</b></a></dt>
  <dd> <!-- description text here -->
    Describes an abstract service (i.e. not a concrete instance of the service) 
  provided by a service provider agent.
  </dd>    



  <dt><a name="gl-serv-req"><b>Service requirement description</b></a> </dt>
  <dd>
    Describes an abstract service required by a service requester agent,
    in the context of service discovery, service brokering, or negotiation.
</dd>


  <dt><a name="gl-sqname"><b>sQName</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <em>Serialized QName</em>.  
    A serialized QName is a shorthand representation of a URI. It is
    a macro that expands into a full-blown URI.
    sQNames are <em>not</em> QNames: the former are URIs, while the latter are
    pairs (<em>URI</em>, <em>local-name</em>).   
    Serialized QNames were originally introduced in RDF as a notation for
    shortening URI representation. Unfortunately, 
    RDF introduced confusion by adopting the term QName for something that is
    different from QNames used in XML. To add to the confusion, RDF uses
    the syntax for sQNames that is identical to XML's syntax for QNames.
    SWSL distinguishes between QNames and sQNames, and uses the
    syntax <em>prefix</em>#<em>local-name</em> for the latter.
    Such an sQName expands into a full URI by concatenating the value
    of <em>prefix</em> with <em>local-name</em>.  
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="gl-uri"><b>URI</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <em>Universal Resource Identifier</em>.  
    A symbol used to locate resources on the Web. URIs are defined by IETF. See
    <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">Uniform Resource Identifiers
    (URI): Generic Syntax</a> for more details.
    Within the IETF standards the notion of URI is an extension
    and refinement of the notions of Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
    and Relative Uniform Resource Locators.
