the assistance of several prominent library historians compiled a list of 40 of 
America’s most significant library leaders up to that point who were not longer 
living (only librarians were included).&nbsp; The title of the article was “A Library 
Hall of Fame: For the 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary [of the ALA]”.&nbsp;</font><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On 
that list were four individuals who were from Wisconsin or who had 
significant Wisconsin connections.&nbsp; They were Mary E. Hazeltine, Theresa 
Elmendorf, Lutie E. Stearns, and Reuben G. Thwaites (see below for information 
about these individuals). If the list had included non-librarians, it would have 
almost certainly included Frank F. Hutchins. Hutchins </span>
