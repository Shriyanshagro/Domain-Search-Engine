<p>I was asked by the Chang School of Continuing Studies at Ryerson University to do a master class on this topic at their <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/02/21/a-full-day-of-experiential-learning-in-action/">ChangSchoolTalks</a> on February 17, based on <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/part/chapter-5-building-an-effective-learning-environment/">Appendix 1</a> in my open, online textbook, <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>.</p>
<p>I was a little surprised by the request. I had moved what had originally been the second chapter of the book to an appendix, as I thought it was rather obvious and most instructors would already be aware of the key factors in an effective learning environment, so I was somewhat nervous about doing a master class for faculty and instructors on this topic.</p>
<p>As it turned out, I need not have worried. The master class was the first to be fully booked and the way the master class developed suggested that participants found the topic both stimulating and challenging. I think the reason for this is that my approach to building an effective learning environment is driven by a particular philosophy of education that is not always understood in post-secondary education. For this reason I thought I would share with you my thoughts on this in this post.</p>
<h2>Learning as a &#8216;natural&#8217; human activity</h2>
<p>One premise behind building an effective learning environment is that it is inbuilt in humans to learn. If we had not been reasonably good at learning, we would have been killed off early in the earth&#8217;s history by faster, bigger and more ferocious animals. The ability not only to learn, but to learn in abstract and conscious ways, is therefore part of human nature.</p>
<p>If that is the case, a teacher&#8217;s job is not to do the learning for the student, but to build a rich environment that facilitates the kind of learning that will benefit the learner. It is not a question of pouring knowledge into a student&#8217;s head, but enabling the learner to develop concepts, think critically, and apply and evaluate what they have learned, by providing opportunities and experiences that are relevant to such goals.</p>
<h2>Learning as development</h2>
<p>A second premise is that knowledge is not fixed or static, but is continually developing. Our concept of heat changes and becomes richer as we grow older and become more educated, from understanding heat through touch, to providing a quantitative way of measuring it, to understanding its physical properties, to being able to apply that knowledge to solving problems, such as designing refrigerators. In a knowledge-based society, knowledge is constantly developing and growing, and our understanding is always developing.</p>
<p>This is one reason why I believe that one negative aspect of competency-based education is its attempt to measure competencies in terms of &#8216;mastery&#8217; and limiting them to competencies required by employers. The difference between a skill and a competency is that there is no limit to a skill. You can continually improve a skill. We should be enabling students to develop skills that will carry them through maybe multiple employers, and enable them to adapt to changing market requirements, for instance.</p>
<p>If then we want students to develop knowledge and skills, we need to provide the right kind of learning environments  that encourage and support such development. Although analogies have their limitations, I like to think of education as gardening, where the learners are the plants. Plants know how to grow; they just need the right environment, the right balance of sun and shadow, the right soil conditions, enough water, etc. Our job as teachers is to make sure we are providing learners with those elements that will allow them to grow and learn. (The analogy breaks down though if we think of learners as having consciousness and free will, which adds an important element to developing an effective learning environment.)</p>
<h2>There are many possible effective learning environments</h2>
<p>Teaching is incredibly context-specific so the learning environment must be suitable to the context. For this reason, every teacher or instructor needs to think about and build their own learning environment that is appropriate to the context in which they are working. Here are some examples of different learning environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a school or college campus</li>
<li>an online course</li>
<li>military training</li>
<li>friends, family and work</li>
<li>nature</li>
<li>personal, technology-based, learning environments</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_10216" style="width: 558px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/wp-content/uploads/Personal-learning-environment-2-Janson-Hews-e1456172033305.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-10216"><img class="size-large wp-image-10216" src="http://www.tonybates.ca/wp-content/uploads/Personal-learning-environment-2-Janson-Hews-548x391.jpg" alt="A personal learning environment Image: jason Hews, Flikr" width="548" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A personal learning environment<br />Image: jason Hews, Flikr</p></div>
<p>Nevertheless I will argue that despite the differences in context, there are certain elements or components that will be found in most effective learning environments.</p>
<p>In developing an effective learning environment, there are two issues I need to address up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it is the learner who has to do the learning.</li>
<li>Second, any learning environment is much more than the technology used to support it.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to the first, teachers cannot do the learning for the learner. All they can do is to create and manage an environment that enables and encourages learning. My focus then in terms of building an effective learning environment is on what the  teacher can do, because in the end that is all they can control. However, the focus of what the teacher does should be on the learner, and what the learner needs. That of course will require good communication between the learners and the teacher.</p>
<p>Second, many technology-based personal learning environments are bereft of some of the key components that make an effective learning environment. The technology may be necessary but it is not sufficient. I suggest below what some of those components are.</p>
<h2>Key components</h2>
<p>These will vary somewhat, depending on the context. I will give examples below, but it is important for every individual teacher to think about what components may be necessary within their own context and then on how best to ensure these components are effectively present and used. (There is a much fuller discussion of this in Appendix 1 of my book)</p>
<h3>Learner characteristics</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important of all the components: the learners themselves. Some of the key characteristics are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>what are their goals and motivation to learn what I am teaching them?</li>
<li>in what contexts (home, campus, online) will they prefer to learn?</li>
<li>how diverse are they in terms of language, culture, and prior knowledge?</li>
<li>how digitally capable are they?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these characteristics, what are the implications for providing an effective learning environment for these specific learners?</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>what content do students need to cover? What are the goals in covering this content?</li>
<li>what sources of content are necessary? Who should find, evaluate, and apply these sources: me or the students? If the learners, what do I need to provide to enable them to do this?</li>
<li>how should the content be structured? Who should do this structuring: me or the learners? If learners, what do I need to provide to help them?</li>
<li>what is the right balance between breadth and depth of content for the learners in this specific context?</li>
<li>what activities will learners need in order to acquire and manage this content?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>what skills do students need to develop?</li>
<li>what activities will enable learners to develop and apply these skills? (e.g. thinking, doing, discussing)</li>
<li>what is the goal in skill development? Mastery? A minimal level of performance? How will learners know this?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learner support</h3>
<ul>
<li>what counselling and/or mentoring will learners need to succeed?</li>
<li>how will learners get feedback (particularly on skills development)?</li>
<li>how will learners relate to other learners so they are mutually supporting?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>how much time can I devote to each of the components of a learning environment? What&#8217;s the best way to split my time?</li>
<li>what help will I get from other teaching staff, e.g. teaching assistants, librarians? What is the best way to use them?</li>
<li>what facilities will the learners have available (e.g. learning spaces, online resources)?</li>
<li>what technology can the learners use; how should this be managed and organized?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
<li>what types of assessment should be used? (formative, essays, e-portfolios, projects)?</li>
<li>how will these measure the content and skills that learners are expected to master?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are meant mainly as examples. Each teacher needs to develop and think about what components will be necessary in their context and how best to provide those components.</p>
<p>For instance, I did not include culture as a component. In some contexts, cultural change is one of the most important goals of education. Negative examples of this might include the culture of privilege encouraged in private British boarding schools, or the attempt to replace indigenous cultures with a western culture, as practiced in Canada with aboriginal residential schools. More positive cultural components may be to encourage inclusivity or ethical behaviour. Again, each teacher should decide on what components are important for their learners.</p>
<h2>Necessary but not sufficient</h2>
<p>Thinking about and implementing these components may be necessary, but they are not sufficient in themselves to ensure quality teaching and learning. In addition effective teaching still needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>good design</li>
<li>empathy for the learners</li>
<li>teacher competence (e.g. subject knowledge)</li>
<li>imagination to create an effective learning environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The learners must do the learning. We need to make sure that learners are able to work within an environment that helps them do this. In other words, our job as teachers is to create the conditions for success.</p>
<p>There are no right or wrong ways to build an effective learning environment. It needs to fit the context in which students will learn. However, before even beginning to design a course or program, we should be thinking of what this learning environment could look like.</p>
<p>Technology now enables us to build a wide variety of effective learning environments. But technology alone is not enough; it needs to include other components for learner success. This is not to say that self-managing learners cannot build their own effective, personal learning environments, but they need to consider the other components as well as the technology.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What other components would you add to a successful learning environment?</li>
<li>Could you now design a different and hopefully better learning environment for your courses or programs? If so, what would it look like?</li>
<li>Is this a helpful way to approach the design of online learning or indeed any other form of learning?</li>
</ol>

<p>Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (2016) <a href="https://icde.memberclicks.net/assets/TeSLA_General_Description.pdf">An Adaptive Trust-based e-assessment system for learning (@TeSLA)</a> Barcelona: UOC</p>
<p>This paper describes a large, collaborative European Commission project headed by the Open University of Catalonia, called TeSLA, (no, not to develop a European electric car, but) a state-of-the-art online assessment system that will be accepted as equal to if not better than traditional face-to-face assessment in higher education.</p>
<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>The project argues that at the moment there is no (European?) online assessment system that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the same level of trust as face-to-face assessment systems</li>
<li>that is universally accepted by educational institutions, accreditation agencies and employers</li>
<li>incorporates pedagogical as well as technical features</li>
<li>integrates with other aspects of teaching and learning</li>
<li>provides true and secure &#8216;authentication&#8217; of authorship.</li>
</ul>
<p>I added the &#8216;European&#8217;, as I think this claim might come as a surprise to Western Governors&#8217; University, which has been successfully using online proctoring for some time. It is also why I used the term &#8216;next generation&#8217; in the heading, as the TeSLA project is aiming at something much more technologically advanced than the current WGU system, which consists mainly of a set of web cameras observing learners taking an assessment (click <a href="http://fusion.net/story/5839/goodbye-classroom-virtual-tests-let-students-stay-home/">here</a> for a demonstration).</p>
<p>Also, the TeSLA proposal makes a good point when it says any comprehensive online assessment system must also be able to handle formative as well as summative assessment, and that this can be a challenge as formative assessment is often embedded in the day-to-day teaching and learning activities.</p>
<p>But the main reason for this project is that online learning assessment currently lacks the credibility of face-to-face assessment.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">A non-invasive system that is able to provide a quality continuous assessment model, using proportionate and necessary controls that will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>ensure student identity and authorship [in a way that offers] accrediting agencies and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>society unambiguous proof of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>academic progression&#8230;.</p>
<p class="p1">Any solution must work fully online and take into account &#8216;academic requirements&#8217; for assessment, including enriched feedback, adaptive learning, formative assessment and personalized learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">This will require the use of technologies that provide reliable and accurate user authentication and identification of authorship, face and voice recognition, and keystroke dynamics recognition (see <a href="https://vimeo.com/152999957">here</a> for video examples of the proposed techniques).</p>
<p class="p1">The solution must result in</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">a system based on demonstrable trust between the institution and its students. Student trust is continuously updated according to their interaction with the institution, such as analysis of their exercises, peer feedback in cooperative activities or teacher confidence information. Evidence is continuously collected and contrasted in order to provide such unambiguous proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p1">The players</h2>
<p>The participants in this project include</p>
<ul>
<li>eight universities,</li>
<li>four research centres,</li>
<li>three educational quality assurance agencies,</li>
<li>three technology companies,</li>
<li>from twelve different countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total the project will have a team of about 80 professionals and will use large-scale pilots involving over 14,000 European students.</p>
<h2>Comment</h2>
<p>I think this is a very interesting project and is likely to grab a lot of attention. At the end of the day, there could well be some significant improvements to online assessment that will actually transfer to multiple online courses and programs.</p>
<p>However, I spent many years working on large European Commission projects and I am certainly glad I don&#8217;t have to do that any more. Quite apart from the truly mindless bureaucracy that always accompanies such projects (the form-filling is vast and endless), there are real challenges in getting together participants who can truly contribute to such a project. Participants are determined more by political considerations, such as regional representation, rather than technical competence. Such projects in the end are largely driven by two or three key players; the remaining participants are more likely to slow down or inhibit the project, and they certainly divert essential funding away from the those most able to make the project succeed. However, these projects are as much about raising the level of all European countries in terms of learning technologies as becoming a world leader in this field.</p>
<p>These criticisms apply to any of the many European Commission projects, but there are some issues that are particular to this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not convinced that there is a real problem here, or at least a problem that requires better technology as a solution. Assessment for online learning has been successfully implemented now for more than 20 years, and while it mostly depends on some form of face-to-face invigilation, this has not proved a major acceptability problem or a barrier to online enrolments. There will always be those who do not accept the equivalence of online learning, and the claimed shortcomings of online assessment are just another excuse for non-acceptance of online learning in general.</li>
<li>Many of the problems of authenticity and authorship are the same for face-to-face assessment. Cheating is not exclusive to online learning, nor is there any evidence that it is more prevalent in online learning where it is provided by properly accredited higher education institutions. Such a study is just as likely to reduce rather than increase trust in online learning by focusing attention on an issue that has not been a big problem to date.</li>
<li>Even if this project does result in more &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; online assessment, there are huge issues of privacy and security of data involved, not to mention the likely cost to institutions. Perhaps the most useful outcome from this project will be a better understanding of these risks, and development of protocols for protecting student privacy and the security of the data collected for this purpose. I wish though that a privacy commissioner was among the eighteen different participants in this project. I fail to see how such a project could be anything but invasive for students, most of whom will be assessed from home.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, this project is well worth tracking. It has the potential to radically change the way we not only assess online learners, but also how we teach them, because assessment always drives learner behaviour. Whether such changes will be on balance beneficial though remains to be seen.</p>

<p>You are probably, like me, getting tired of the different predictions for 2016. So I’m not going to do my usual look forward for the year for individual developments in online learning. Instead, I want to raise a fundamental question about which direction online learning should be heading in the future, because the next year could turn out to be very significant in determining the future of online learning.</p>
<p>The key question we face is whether online learning should aim to replace teachers and instructors through automation, or whether technology should be used to empower not only teachers but also learners. Of course, the answer will always be a mix of both, but getting the balance right is critical.</p>
<h2><strong>An old but increasingly important question</strong></h2>
<p>This question, automation or human empowerment, is not new. It was raised by B.F. Skinner (1968) when he developed teaching machines in the early 1960s. He thought teaching machines would eventually replace teachers. On the other hand, Seymour Papert (1980) wanted computing to empower learners, not to teach them directly. In the early 1980s Papert got children to write computer code to improve the way they think and to solve problems. Papert was strongly influenced by Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, and in particular that children constructed rather than absorbed knowledge.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, as personal computers became more common, computer-assisted learning (CAL or CAD) became popular, using computer-marked tests and early forms of adaptive learning. Also in the 1980s the first developments in artificial intelligence were applied, in the form of intelligent math tutoring. Great predictions were made then, as now, about the potential of AI to replace teachers.</p>
<p>Then along came the Internet. Following my first introduction to the Internet in a friend’s basement in Vancouver, I published an article in the first edition of the <em>Journal of Distance Education</em>, entitled ‘Computer-assisted learning or communications: which way for IT in distance education?’ (1986). In this paper I argued that the real value of the Internet and computing was to enable asynchronous interaction and communication between teacher and learners, and between learners themselves, rather than as teaching machines. This push towards a more constructivist approach to the use of computing in education was encapsulated in Mason and Kaye’s book, Mindweave (1989). Linda Harasim has since argued that online collaborative learning is an important theory of learning in its own right (Harasim, 2012).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, David Noble of York University attacked online learning in particular for turning universities into ‘Digital Diploma Mills’:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘universities are not only undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher education.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Noble (1998) argued that</p>
<blockquote><p>‘high technology, at these universities, is often used not to ……improve teaching and research, but to replace the visions and voices of less-prestigious faculty with the second-hand and reified product of academic &#8220;superstars&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, contrary to Noble’s warnings, for fifteen years most university online courses followed more the route of interaction and communication between teachers and students than computer-assisted learning or video lectures, and Noble’s arguments were easily dismissed or forgotten.</p>
<p>Then along came lecture capture and with it, in 2011, Massive Open Online Courses (xMOOCs) from Coursera, Udacity and edX, driven by elite, highly selective universities, with their claims of making the best professors in the world available to everyone for free. Noble&#8217;s nightmare suddenly became very real. At the same time, these MOOCs have resulted in much more interest in big data, learning analytics, a revival of adaptive learning, and claims that artificial intelligence will revolutionize education, since automation is essential for managing such massive courses.</p>
<p>Thus we are now seeing a big swing back to the automation of learning, driven by powerful computing developments, Silicon Valley start-up thinking, and a sustained political push from those that want to commercialize education (more on this later). Underlying these developments is a fundamental conflict of philosophies and pedagogies, with automation being driven by an objectivist/behaviourist view of the world, compared with the constructivist approaches of online collaborative learning.</p>
<p>In other words, there are increasingly stark choices to be made about the future of online learning. Indeed, it is almost too late &#8211; I fear the forces of automation are winning &#8211; which is why 2016 will be such a pivotal year in this debate.</p>
<h2><strong>Automation and the commercialization of education</strong></h2>
<p>These developments in technology are being accompanied by a big push in the United States, China, India and other countries towards the commercialization of online learning. In other words, education is being seen increasingly as a commodity that can be bought and sold. This is not through the previous and largely discredited digital diploma mills of the for-profit online universities such as the University of Phoenix that David Noble feared, but rather through the encouragement and support of commercial computer companies moving into the education field, companies such as Coursera, Lynda.com and Udacity.</p>
<p>Audrey Watters and EdSurge both produced lists of EdTech ‘deals’ in 2015 totalling between $1-$2 billion. Yes, that’s right, that’s $1-$2 billion in investment in private ed tech companies in the USA (and China) in one year alone. At the same time, entrepreneurs are struggling to develop sustainable business models for ed tech investment, because with education funded publicly, a ‘true’ market is restricted. Politicians, entrepreneurs and policy makers on the right in the USA increasingly see a move to automation as a way of reducing government expenditure on education, and one means by which to ‘free up the market’.</p>
<p>Another development that threatens the public education model is the move by very rich entrepreneurs such as the Gates, the Hewletts and the Zuckerbergs to move their massive personal wealth into ‘charitable’ foundations or corporations and use this money for their pet ‘educational’ initiatives that also have indirect benefits for their businesses. Ian McGugan (2015) in the Globe and Mail newspaper estimates that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> is worth potentially $45 billion, and one of its purposes is to promote the personalization of learning (another name hi-jacked by computer scientists; it&#8217;s a more human way of describing adaptive learning). Since one way Facebook makes its money is by selling personal data, forgive my suspicions that the Zuckerberg initiative is a not-so-obvious way of collecting data on future high earners. At the same time, the Chang Zuckerberg initiative enables the Zuckerberg’s to avoid paying tax on their profits from Facebook. Instead then of paying taxes that could be used to support public education, these immensely rich foundations enable a few entrepreneurs to set the agenda for how computing will be used in education.</p>
<h2><strong>Why not?</strong></h2>
<p>Technology is disrupting nearly every other business and profession, so why not education? Higher education in particular requires a huge amount of money, mostly raised through taxes and tuition fees, and it is difficult to tie results directly to investment. Surely we should be looking at ways in which technology can change higher education so that it is more accessible, more affordable and more effective in developing the knowledge and skills required in today’s and tomorrow’s society?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It is not so much the need for change that I am challenging, but the means by which this change is being promoted. In essence, a move to automated learning, while saving costs, will not improve the learning that matters, and particularly the outcomes needed in a digital age, namely, the high level intellectual skills of critical thinking, innovation, entrepreneurship, problem-solving , high-level multimedia communication, and above all, effective knowledge management.</p>
<p>To understand why automated approaches to learning are inappropriate to the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century we need to look particularly at the tools and methods being proposed.</p>
<h2><strong>The problems with automating learning</strong></h2>
<p>The main challenge for computer-directed learning such as information transmission and management through Internet-distributed video lectures, computer-marked assessments, adaptive learning, learning analytics, and artificial intelligence is that they are based on a model of learning that has limited applications. Behaviourism works well in assisting rote memory and basic levels of comprehension, but does not enable or facilitate deep learning, critical thinking and the other skills that are essential for learners in a digital age.</p>
<p>R. and D. Susskind (2015) in particular argue that there is a new age in artificial intelligence and adaptive learning driven primarily by what they call the brute force of more powerful computing. Why AI failed so dramatically in the 1980s, they argue, was because computer scientists tried to mimic the way that humans think, and computers then did not have the capacity to handle information in the way they do now. When however we use the power of today&#8217;s computing, it can solve previously intractable problems through analysis of massive amounts of data in ways that humans had not considered.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this argument. The first is that the Susskinds are correct in that computers operate differently from humans. Computers are mechanical and work basically on a binary operating system. Humans are biological and operate in a far more sophisticated way, capable of language creation as well as language interpretation, and use intuition as well as deductive thinking. Emotion as well as memory drives human behaviour, including learning. Furthermore humans are social animals, and depend heavily on social contact with other humans for learning. In essence humans learn differently from the way machine automation operates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computer scientists frequently ignore or are unaware of the research into human learning. In particular they are unaware that learning is largely developmental and constructed, and instead impose an old and less appropriate method of teaching based on behaviourism and an objectivist epistemology. If though we want to develop the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, we need a more constructivist approach to learning.</p>
<p>Supporters of automation also make another mistake in over-estimating or misunderstanding how AI and learning analytics operate in education. These tools reflect a highly objectivist approach to teaching, where procedures can be analysed and systematised in advance. However, although we know a great deal about learning in general, we still know very little about how thinking and decision-making operate biologically in individual cases. At the same time, although brain research is promising to unlock some of these secrets, most brain scientists argue that while we are beginning to understand the relationship between brain activity and very specific forms of behaviour, there is a huge distance to travel before we can explain how these mechanisms affect learning in general or how an individual learns in particular. There are too many variables (such as emotion, memory, perception, communication, as well as neural activity) at play to find an isomorphic fit between the firing of neurons and computer &#8216;intelligence&#8217;.</p>
<p>The danger then with automation is that we drive humans to learn in ways that best suit how machines operate, and thus deny humans the potential of developing the higher levels of thinking that make humans different from machines. For instance, humans are better than machines at dealing with volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous situations, which is where we find ourselves in today’s society.</p>
<p>Lastly, both AI and adaptive learning depend on algorithms that predict or direct human behaviour. These algorithms though are not transparent to the end users. To give an example, learning analytics are being used to identify students at high risk of failure, based on correlations of previous behaviour online by previous students. However, for an individual, should a software program be making the decision as to whether that person is suitable for higher education or a particular course? If so, should that person know the grounds on which they are considered unsuitable and be able to challenge the algorithm or at least the principles on which that algorithm is based? Who makes the decision about these algorithms – a computer scientist using correlated data, or an educator concerned with equitable access? The more we try to automate learning, the greater the danger of unintended consequences, and the more need for educators rather than computer scientists to control the decision-making.</p>
<h2><strong>The way forward</strong></h2>
<p>In the past, I used to think of computer scientists as colleagues and friends in designing and delivering online learning. I am now increasingly seeing at least some of them as the enemy. This is largely to do with the hubris of Silicon Valley, which believes that computer scientists can solve any problem without knowing anything about the problem itself. MOOCs based on recorded lectures are a perfect example of this, being developed primarily by a few computer scientists from Stanford (and unfortunately blindly copied by many people in universities who should have known better.)</p>
<p>We need to start with the problem, which is how do we prepare learners for the knowledge and skills they will need in today’s society. I have argued (Bates, 2015) that we need to develop, in very large numbers of people, high level intellectual and practical skills that require the construction and development of knowledge, and that enable learners to find, analyse, evaluate and apply knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>This requires a constructivist approach to learning which cannot be appropriately automated, as it depends on high quality interaction between knowledge experts and learners. There are many ways to accomplish this, and technology can play a leading role, by enabling easy access to knowledge, providing opportunities for practice in experientially-based learning environments, linking communities of scholars and learners together, providing open access to unlimited learning resources, and above all by enabling students to use technology to access, organise and demonstrate their knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>These activities and approaches do not easily lend themselves to massive economies of scale through automation, although they do enable more effective outcomes and possibly some smaller economies of scale. Automation can be helpful in developing some of the foundations of learning, such as basic comprehension or language acquisition. But at the heart of developing the knowledge and skills needed in today’s society, the role of a human teacher, instructor or guide will remain absolutely essential. Certainly, the roles of teachers and instructors will need to change quite dramatically, teacher training and faculty development will be critical for success, and we need to use technology to enable students to take more responsibility for their own learning, but it is a dangerous illusion to believe that automation is the solution to learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<h2><strong>Protecting the future</strong></h2>
<p>There are several practical steps that need to be taken to prevent the automation of teaching.</p>
<ol>
<li>Educators – and in particular university presidents and senior civil servants with responsibility for education – need to speak out clearly about the dangers of automation, and the technology alternatives available that still exploit its potential and will lead to greater cost-effectiveness. This is not an argument against the use of technology in education, but the need to use it wisely so we get the kind of educated population we need in the 21st century.</li>
<li>Computer scientists need to show more respect to educators and be less arrogant. This means working collaboratively with educators, and treating them as equals.</li>
<li>We – teachers and educational technologists – need to apply in our own work and disseminate better to those outside education what we already know about effective learning and teaching.</li>
<li>Faculty and teachers need to develop compelling technology alternatives to automation that focus on the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, such as:
<ul>
<li>experiential learning through virtual reality (e.g. Loyalist College&#8217;s training of border service agents)</li>
<li>networking learners online with working professionals, to solve real world problems (e.g. by developing a program similar to McMaster&#8217;s integrated science program for online/blended delivery)</li>
<li>building strong communities of practice through connectivist MOOCs (e.g. on climate change or mental health) to solve global problems</li>
<li>empowering students to use social media to research and demonstrate their knowledge through multimedia e-portfolios (e.g. UBC&#8217;s ETEC 522)</li>
<li>designing openly accessible high quality, student-activated simulations and games but designed and monitored by experts in the subject area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governments need to put as much money into research into learning and educational technology as they do into innovation in industry. Without better and more defensible theories of learning suitable for a digital age, we are open to any quack or opportunist who believes he or she has the best snake oil. More importantly, with better theory and knowledge of learning disseminated and applied appropriately, we can have a much more competitive workforce and a more just society.</li>
<li>We need to educate our politicians about the dangers of commercialization in education through the automation of learning and fight for a more equal society where the financial returns on technology applications are more equally shared.</li>
<li>Become <a href="http://www.utne.com/politics/meet-the-edupunks-radical-self-education.aspx">edupunks</a> and take back the web from powerful commercial interests by using open source, low cost, easy to use tools in education that protect our privacy and enable learners and teachers to control how they are used.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should keep you busy in 2016.</p>
<p>Your views are of course welcome – unless you are a bot.</p>

<p>Alexander, I. (2015) <a href="http://www.filmindustrynetwork.biz/over-30000-students-took-these-online-film-and-media-courses/29923">Over 30,000 students took these online film and media courses</a> <em>Film Industry Network</em>, November 17</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, the former MOOC provider which has now moved to offering more vocational online courses, but I was interested in this article, which lists the 10 most popular online courses offered in film and media studies.  Udemy offers a number of these courses, but it is also facing strong competition from Masterclass, another provider of low cost, not-for-credit, online courses.</p>
<p>The average cost of a film and media studies program at a university in the USA is around $30,000. Udemy is offering courses in this domain from $300 downwards, some as little as $10 as promotional courses. However, this excludes the cost of the necessary equipment, which the article estimates at around $5,000.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are huge savings to be made by going for these very low cost online courses. For instance, in the <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/">Masterclass series</a>, you can <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/dustin-hoffman-teaches-acting?utm_source=Paid&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_term=Aq-Prospecting&amp;utm_content=FIN&amp;utm_campaign=DH">learn acting from Dustin Hoffman</a>, or <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/serena-williams-teaches-tennis">tennis with Serena Williams</a>, for as little as $90, through five hours of video lessons.</p>
<p>Most of the Udemy lessons on these courses are very short videos (less than six minutes each), although there are lots (50 in Udemy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.udemy.com/facebook-pages/?siteID=wxM3zRwLprU-mnVNPQatH.RWAjWFKz1csw&amp;LSNPUBID=wxM3zRwLprU">Facebook Marketing</a> course, for example). Courses range in length of study, but are mainly in the range of two to ten hours each. Udemy offers a certificate for successful completion of these courses.</p>
<h2>Comment</h2>
<p>I have mixed feelings about these offerings. I can see that for people who want to dabble in the field or want to top up on their knowledge of a particular topic, such as Twitter marketing, or are interested in film or media production as a hobby, these courses are extremely good value. In particular, the Masterclass courses seem an excellent deal.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s hard to see how this would qualify anyone to work professionally in the field. There is no feedback from or interaction with the instructor, and no quality assessment of what has been learned.</p>
<p>So as always with MOOCs and their variations, there are large numbers of people who will get something they value from such courses. However, to pretend that such programs will enable people to get a well-paid, professional job in film and media on these qualifications alone is highly misleading. So it all depends on how they are marketed. Udemy walks quite close to the line on this.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;d be interested to hear from anyone who has taken these courses. What was your motivation? Were you satisfied? What would you recommend to others thinking of taking such courses?</p>

<h2>Why you should read this book</h2>
<p>From the book cover:</p>
<blockquote><p>This analysis of the Open University&#8217;s precedents, personalities, politics and pedagogies contextualises learners&#8217; experiences and illuminates the change in the values of our society, our ideas about learning and our use of a variety of media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the florid writing in the publisher&#8217;s blurb, this is an accurate summary of the importance of this book, which should be read by anyone interested in open learning, distance learning, equality of access to higher education, changing pedagogies, the role of media in teaching and learning, the politics of creating radically new institutions of higher education, how higher education has changed in terms of value and purpose over the last 45 years, and, most important of all, how open learning can truly transform the lives of individuals.</p>
<h2>What the book covers</h2>
<p>The book is in four parts, which I will briefly summarise.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Part I: Creating a university of the air</h3>
<p>This part covers the origins of the university within the socio-political context of Britain in the 1960s and early 1970s. It is a fascinating story in itself, of how a Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and Jennie Lee, his Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Education and Science, drove through their vision of a technocratic university for the masses, how the original vision was modified from a University of the Air to a multi-media university, and how the university survived a change of government which brought Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives to power in the year that the OU opened. This is mandatory reading for policy wonks interested in how to bring about radical change in higher education.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 provides a broad overview of the challenges, developments and successes of the university over its 45 years existence. For those without the time to read the whole book, this chapter provides a useful encapsulation of the main points covered later.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 provides a more detailed account of the creation of the university, covering the political, socio-economic, pedagogical, and media components. It should be noted that many commentators believe that the Open University was &#8216;the most original innovation in 20th century British higher education&#8217; and a &#8216;national treasure.&#8217; This chapter helps to explain why.</p>
<p>In this part of the book, Weinbren captures well the social and political conditions, and above all the idealism and philosophies, that underpinned the creation and establishment of the Open University.</p>
<h3>Part II: The first two decades</h3>
<p>It is one thing to create a new institution; it is quite another to make it work. Indeed, the author notes that other attempts at innovation in higher education, such as the UK Open Polytechnic and the OU e-University, failed dismally after being created.</p>
<p>This part looks in detail at the governance and administrative structures, the role of academics, tutors and counsellors, the pedagogical models, the use of media, and the regional structure.</p>
<p>Weinbren points out that the intention from the start was to develop a degree-granting university with the highest possible academic standards:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jennie Lee was adamant that the OU should be comparable to other universities in terms of its academic standards, rather than merely representing an educational second chance for the marginalised.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason for the OU&#8217;s relatively quick acceptance by the rest of the UK higher education sector was the high quality of the course materials which were used extensively by professors (and students) in the other universities. Another reason was the widespread engagement of academics from other universities as tutors or external examiners, who were often initially surprised by the quality of work produced by OU students.</p>
<p>Weinbren addresses particularly well the challenges the OU faced in terms of scale and the need for learner support for students working alone all over the country. (The OU started on day one in 1971 with 25,000 students and has grown since to 150,000 undergraduates and 30,000 postgraduates in 2014, with almost as many taking non-credit courses or modules.)</p>
<p>Weinbren, like the OU itself, struggles with integrating the competing pedagogical philosophies of behaviourist approaches to the design and development of high quality, mass-produced, course materials, and  learner-centred approaches based on face-to-face tutorials and summer schools. Overall, though, he emphasises that the fundamental pedagogical approach of the OU is focused on students developing personal meaning through interaction not only with course materials but also with faculty/tutors and other students, both face-to-face and later online. He describes with clarity how the often changing and complex learner support systems worked.</p>
<p>This chapter also explains why the Conservatives under Mrs. Thatcher continued to support the OU, despite concerns from some Ministers and the national press about &#8216;Marxist bias&#8217; in its publicly available materials (especially the broadcasts). Thatcher had little time for traditional universities and saw in the OU a chance for reforming and galvanising the higher education system, especially with regard to improved cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This chapter also discusses the rapid development and changes in the use of media at the OU, with broadcasting over time playing a less direct role in teaching, greater use of recorded media such as cassettes, and the development of home experiment kits for science and technology courses.</p>
<h3>Part III: The OU since the 1990s</h3>
<p>This part is much influenced by the many changes since 1990 in the overall higher education system in Britain, and the consequent attempts by the OU at adaptation and accommodation to such changes. The key change has been the shift from direct government funding for teaching and learning to funding largely through student fees supported by loans (the OU now relies almost entirely on student fees), and the attempt by governments (both Labour and Conservative) to introduce more competition between universities and a more &#8216;market-oriented&#8217; approach. This has resulted in the OU being treated as just any other university by government, rather than the special and separate treatment it received in earlier years.</p>
<p>Also over the past 45 years, the whole HE sector in the UK has expanded rapidly, making access at least theoretically more open to a much higher proportion of the population. Another important development has been the increased use of online learning by conventional universities. Together these have eroded some of the unique differences and advantages of the OU over the rest of the system.</p>
<p>The OU has responded to these changes in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>expanding its international reach, especially but not exclusively in the rest of Europe;</li>
<li>the development of continuing education courses and modules;</li>
<li>more diversification regionally to respond to national political devolution;</li>
<li>contracts with non-commercial agencies, such as the National Health Service, as well as commercial organisations</li>
<li>leading the charge to quality assurance processes;</li>
<li>moving increasingly to online learning, and in the process, reducing dramatically the high-cost summer schools and face-to-face tutorial support; and integrating the role of counsellors with that of tutors;</li>
<li>increased use of learner-centred and project-based learning;</li>
<li>creation of open educational resources, such as FutureLearn and BBC/OU programs aimed at the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Weinbren does a good job of covering the increasingly diverse and wide-ranging activities of the OU in the years from 1990 to the present, the OU&#8217;s unique role and place in the UK HE system becomes inevitably more fuzzy and its future direction less clear. However, the same criticism could apply to the whole of the UK HE sector, which seems to be increasingly forced back to a highly selective and tiered system, by government policies based on a more commercialised and employer-focused view of higher education. The OU&#8217;s place in such a system is by no means clear.</p>
<h3>Part IV: Half a century of learning</h3>
<p>This is a truly wonderful chapter about the student experience at the OU and lets students speak in their own words. This chapter helps explain why the OU is such an iconic component of British culture, and why it is so loved by students and staff alike (it consistently comes out top in student satisfaction in annual surveys of British universities). More importantly, this chapter clearly demonstrates how the OU has changed millions of students lives for the better.</p>
<p>Weinbren looks at several aspects of the student experience. While the OU has a very broad mix of incomes and occupations, it has opened up higher education particularly to working class families, students with disabilities, prisoners, those without high school qualifications, and above all to women. In this sense it is a truly open university, offering not just opportunities but also qualifications and realistic chances of success for everyone.</p>
<p>Weinbren illustrates how important the OU has been to women, particularly in the early year of the OUs, in terms of personal development and increased self-esteem. The importance of summer schools for engaging students and making them feel part of a university community is particularly well described. I also read with great interest how the OU enabled both Republican and Loyalist prisoners in Northern Ireland &#8216;to develop political confidence and an understanding of methods other than violence&#8217;, some going on to become politicians following the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.</p>
<p>Above all, this chapter provides an excellent antidote to the current market-oriented and functional philosophy of higher education now so prevalent in Britain and elsewhere. If you can read only one chapter, this is the one.</p>
<h2>Personal reflections on the book</h2>
<p>The OU was a very important part of my life for 20 years. I was one of the first staff appointed in 1969, and I ended up doing at one time or another research and evaluation into the educational effectiveness of different media (including the BBC television and radio programs), designing and writing course units, marking student assignments, directing summer schools, and attending endless meetings about policies, directions and the use of media. I left the OU in 1989, partly because I was frustrated that it wasn&#8217;t changing fast enough, particularly with regard to the use of online learning. It&#8217;s hard for me then to be objective in reviewing Weinbren&#8217;s book and even more so in assessing the contribution of the OU to higher education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the book captures wonderfully my lived experience of the OU, especially the student response. Weibren has blended together an impeccable range of resources, anecdotes, events and above all personal contributions from academics, staff and students at the OU into a well-written, captivating chronicle that reflects the spirit as well as the history of the OU.</p>
<p>There are criticisms, of course. At times, it becomes a hagiography of an institution (if that&#8217;s possible). Weinbren does describe the many criticisms of the OU, but always provides a contradictory positive contribution to offset each criticism. In particular, he could have been harsher about the OU&#8217;s increased bureaucracy and sclerosis as it has become older. True, there have been many innovations, for instance, in the use of technology, but changing its cumbersome and now outdated course development system has proved to be extremely difficult. Although it was one of the first institutions to adopt online learning, it has been a real struggle to make it a central rather than a peripheral part of the teaching system.</p>
<p>More importantly, Weinbren does not look into the future, yet there are surely lessons for the future from his book. The OU is facing an almost existential crisis, with many competitors, a very difficult financial situation, and massive changes and innovation going on elsewhere in the UK higher education system. What is the role of the OU in the 21st century? In what ways can it continue to provide a unique and valuable contribution? What teaching model will best meet the needs of its students in the 21st century? This is probably another book altogether, but Weinbren is particularly well placed to ask and address these issues. As I say to Ph.D. students, the conclusion is your chance to let rip and say what you really think now you have established your credentials. It&#8217;s a pity that Weinbren did not take this opportunity, but he has probably other means to let his views be known.</p>
<p>These though are minor caveats. Weinbren has undertaken an extremely challenging task and met the challenge superbly. I hope you will enjoy the book as much as I have. More importantly, there are very important lessons to be drawn from this book about the nature of university education, equity, and government policy toward higher education.</p>
