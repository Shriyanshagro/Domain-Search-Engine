<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 17 November 2007</p>
<p>A while back we upgraded nginx, the frontend proxy software that accepts
all Web, IMAP and POP connections and proxies them to the users correct
backend server. At the time we upgraded, it appears we did restart the
web portion of the software, but not the part that proxies the IMAP and
POP connections, so it was running the old version of the software
still.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/2007/11/17/expired-certificate-for-mailmessagingenginecom/">upgrading the SSL certificate
yesterday</a>,
we restarted both the web and POP/IMAP parts of nginx. During the
restart it used the new upgraded versions of the software. Unfortunately
it turns out the new software had an incompatible change that meant that
anyone using a % in their password would not have been able to login.</p>

<p>We've now fixed up the appropriate bits of software to make them
compatible again so all logins should be working again.</p>
