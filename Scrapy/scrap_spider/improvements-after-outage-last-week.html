<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  3 October 2010</p>
<p>This is a technical post. Regular Fastmail users subscribed to receive

<p>Last week we had an outage that affected all users that lasted <a href="http://status.fastmail.fm/2010/09/30/all-services-are-down/">for
about 1
hour</a>. This
is one of the worst outages we’ve had in the last 4 years. Our overall
reliability over the last 4 years can be put down to our <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_reliability.html">redundant
slots &amp; stores
architecture</a> and
using a very

<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2010/07/07/most-reliable-hosting-company-sites-in-june-2010-8.html">provider</a>
(NYI).</p>

<p>The outage last week was a sequence of events caused by a recent
internal change. We changed over our internal DNS server to slave off
Opera’s servers to allow better internal DNS integration. Unfortunately
we were only part way through that process, and we had only setup one
internal server. It’s our general policy that everything we setup these
days must be replicated between at least two servers which we had
intended to do, but hadn’t got around to.</p>

<p>That internal DNS server was also running on the server that’s our
primary database server. Unfortunately that server crashed with a kernel
panic. Normally we’d just fail everything over to our replica database
server, but because the internal DNS server was also down, all our tools
which expected to be able to resolve internal domain names also failed,
and we weren’t able to fail over easily. Also because the internal DNS
was down, we weren’t easily able to access the remote management module
(RMM) of the server to reboot it, and had to go through the NYI ticket
system, which always takes a bit longer.</p>

<p>The net result is something that we should have detected within a few
minutes, and easily failed over with our failover tools, took almost an
hour to do in the end.</p>

<p>We’ve now setup the internal DNS servers to be part of our standard
redundant setup. We’ve also setup consistent naming and IP addresses for
all our RMM modules so that they’ll be easier to access, and even if
there are DNS problems, we’ll be able to access them via IP.</p>

<p>We can’t stop servers crashing, but we aim to have every service
redundant so that if any server fails, we can fail over to a replica
within a short amount of time, either automatically where possible, or
manually where we think it’s better to have some human intervention
first.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that our continuous attempts to improve reliability
have been working very well, and we always aim to learn from any
problems and do better.</p>
