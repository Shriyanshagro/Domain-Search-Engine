<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Season 5, Episode 8: &#8216;Eldorado&#8217;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>But he grew old &#8212;<br />
This knight so bold &#8212;<br />
And o’er his heart a shadow &#8212;<br />
Fell as he found<br />
No spot on the ground<br />
That looked like Eldorado.</em><br />
<strong>&#8212; Edgar Allan Poe, <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/eldorado/">“Eldorado”</a><br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So we come to the end, my friends, which takes us right back to the beginning. This series finale is titled &#8220;Eldorado,&#8221; and like the first episode this season, it is gilded, to subliminally deliver the more obvious message of the dangers of greed.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We begin with a shot of clothes on a beach, a cigarette case, a lighter, a pair of shoes, the surf lapping gently at the pile. We see Nucky’s bare feet and naked back as he walks into the surf, like the boy who dove into the sea in that first episode  searching for gold coins. Is it a baptism of sorts? Is he committing suicide? This episode has barely even begun.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky (Steve Buscemi) swims out, past the breakers, farther and farther. Just like the Golden Man – El Hombre Dorado, from which the legend of El Dorado is taken. It was the name used by the Spaniards to describe the native Colombian chief who, covered in gold dust, dove into a lake as part of a tribal ritual. It was the promise of the gold in the mythical empire of El Dorado that propelled the conquistadors toward the continent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We flash back to Nucky (Marc Pickering) as a young deputy sheriff walking along the boardwalk. He stops at the Corner Hotel and makes his pitch to the Commodore (John Ellison Conlee) for being the new sheriff.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Commodore is spouting his lessons once again and tells Nucky that it’s what you leave behind that counts. “That’s the only thing that anyone’s ever going to know about you,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky, always obsequious when it comes to the Commodore, says he must be proud of what he’ll be remembered for. But the Commodore contradicts him. “For what? Wooden hotels? Rolling carts?” These are things that one bad storm will easily wash away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Commodore asks if he has children, and Nucky says one is expected.  “Children get in the way,” the Commodore says, dismissively. “In the end, we do what we have the nerve for, or we disappear.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky says he’s been loyal, that he has kept his mouth shut about the you-know-what. The fact that the Commodore is a pedophile.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Are you threatening me?” the Commodore asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A teacher with a half-dozen little girls – in golden crowns – interrupts and asks if they can recite for the Commodore. The pedophile is thrilled. Ick.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Ah! what pleasant visions haunt me,” they recite, from &#8220;The Secret of the Sea&#8221; by Longfellow. “As I gaze upon the sea! All the old romantic legends, all my dreams, come back to me.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We cut to Joe Kennedy (Matt Letscher) meeting with the Mayflower Grain Corporation board and Senator Wendell Lloyd (Michael Siberry). Remember him from Cuba? Senator Lloyd is telling them that the word on the hill is that repeal of prohibition is not going to happen. The board members are clamoring to sell their stock at 33 and 1/8, the highest it’s ever been. But Kennedy is trying to talk them down, saying that Hoover is out and F.D.R. is in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s Roosevelt, boys,&#8221; Kennedy says. &#8220;Prohibition’s over. You can take that to the bank.&#8221; He asks them to hold steady for 24 hours while he sorts things out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Capone’s office, lighted by a golden chandelier, his lawyer is trying to break it to him that he’s going to prison for $2 million in unpaid taxes. On Capone’s desk is a line of golden elephants with their trunks up – a sign of prosperity and good luck. But Capone’s luck has run out. He has 24 hours to turn himself in to D’Angelo, whose real name was Malone (rhymes with Capone!). “An Irishman,” Capone says. “That’s what hurts the most.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone (Stephen Graham) is telling the lawyer to do his job, “to make some calls, grease some palms. Deal with it, for Christ’s sakes.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Luciano’s digs – the newly built Art Deco Majestic apartment house on Central Park West and 72nd Street – the luck is still holding out. One of the scantily clad molls walks around in shiny gold high heels. There’s a bouquet of bright yellow flowers beside the gold-painted fireplace. Lansky (Anatol Yusef) runs down a list of all the mob bosses who are being invited to their meeting. Bugsy (Michael Zegen) jokes, “Are those types of cheeses?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While another moll gives Luciano (Vincent Piazza) a manicure, he reminisces about the old days, having a meeting years ago in Atlantic City. “I remember thinking, &#8216;I’m with the big boys now.&#8217; Now look at us.” Luciano’s droopy eye seems to be getting droopier with every episode. He says that anyone who’s not on board with the new organization is a goner: Waxey Gordon, Dutch Schultz, Dr. Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“All about moving forward, ain’t it?” Bugsy says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At Connors and Gould, Margaret’s firm, an angry Kennedy barges in to her gold-wallpapered office. A golden ticker sits on her desk. “You’re shorting my firm’s stock &#8212;  you and your husband,” he says to Margaret (Kelly Macdonald), who’s dressed in a very groovy purple suit. “Which of your clients is twisting the arm of Senator Lloyd?” he asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I have no idea who that is,” Margaret says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Your husband does, and he’s trying to screw me. I prefer to do the screwing myself.” Ha!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Kennedy then realizes it’s Margaret who’s shorting the Mayflower stock. “You’re the mastermind,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“All I know is what I read in the papers,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He says the plan won’t work, that his partners will stay the course. But she tells him the stock has fallen nearly three points in the last hour. His partners are selling in increments, behind his back, she says. Margaret suggests he sell as well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Unload your entire position and then sell short along with my client.” She tells him to open an account under an assumed name. “Cash out in one. Sell short in another.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I need to call my broker,” he says. Margaret pushes the phone toward him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flash back to Nucky returning to find Mabel’s bloody garments on the floor. Mabel (Maya Kazan) is sitting toward the back of the house, her hair wet, a yellow shawl on her lap. She’s had a miscarriage. Nucky is trying to understand what’s happened and wants to call the doctor. “A mishap,” she says. “It passed quickly. No need for the doctor.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Is the baby all right?” he asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Not a baby,” she says. “Just a mishap.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky is terribly worried about her and kneels before her, apologizing for not being there when it happened.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I work for this,” he says. “Everything. For this. I love you. I disappoint you whatever I do, don’t I?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She touches his head lovingly but doesn’t answer.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly there’s a knock at the door. It’s his brother,  Eli (Ryan Dinning). “Ma needs you,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Margaret’s office, all hell has broken loose. Mayflower stock is falling fast. Kennedy is eager, but Margaret insists that “it hasn’t found the bottom yet.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fights break out. People are punching each other. A golden light shines through the office partition.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This is a dangerous game you’re playing, Mrs. Thompson,” a strung-out Kennedy says. Margaret is nervous as well. She watches the price drop further and further, marked on a chalkboard above everyone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At 3 and 1/4, she summons a broker and commands, “Close these short positions in Mayflower.” While the broker makes the call, they wait anxiously.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Three things are difficult to understand in this world, Kennedy says. The work of the bees, the movements of the tide and the mind of a woman. But she has a comeback, as usual. (I love Margaret and will miss her dearly.) “Think about the things you want in life and then picture yourself in a dress.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They get the thumbs up from the broker. “You’ve just made some money,” Margaret tells Kennedy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Then let me shake your hand,” he says. Her palms are sweaty.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There’s a lot we can do together,” Kennedy says. Wink, wink.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I was just thinking the same thing,” she says. “Come see me during office hours. The firm would love to have your business.” Ha.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Capone’s house, where the walls are all painted a golden yellow, his wife, Mae (Marcella Lentz-Pope), is fretting about what’s to come. A reporter stopped by from The Tribune and asked a lot of questions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells her not to worry. Then goes upstairs to see their partially deaf son. The kid is about 12 years old now and is sitting on his bedroom floor reading about Lewis and Clark.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I may be going away for a while, Sonny,” Capone says. “I did some bad things, and now I’m in trouble.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This kid has the saddest face in the history of sad faces. “I will help you,” he says, tearing up. So sad.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You can’t help me with this,” says Capone, who’s also tearing up. “You need to listen to your mother.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0334318/">Stephen Graham</a> is my favorite actor on this show. He is astounding. He is making me cry over the thought of Al Capone, a cold-blooded, maniacal killer, going to jail. “Be a good boy. Remember all I did was for you. To leave you with something better and that can’t be for nothing.” Now we’re all in tears. Capone, the kid with the saddest eyes in the world, and me.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When the kid puts his fists up, echoing an earlier episode when Capone was trying to teach him to fight, I really lose it. Capone comes and hugs him. I’m down for the count. (For all you Capone fans out there, Sonny was born with congenital syphilis and, after brain surgery, was left partially deaf. As an adult, he changed his name to Brown, to disassociate himself with his father, and died in 2004 at 85.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We cut back to Margaret, dressed in a very snazzy orange frock. She&#8217;s at Nucky’s empty apartment in the Eldorado, which is about 20 blocks north of the Majestic. This luxury two-towered Art Deco Central Park West building was just finished in 1931. (It’s been the home of Sinclair Lewis, Alec Baldwin and Moby, among other celebrities.) But Nucky is selling his place.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Margaret finds Nucky on the balcony. A golden curtain shimmers behind her. She tells him he’s done well &#8212; $2,364,120. She tells him that for her 1,000 shares, she earned $29,925. Not bad for a day’s work</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When she asks him for advice on what to do with all that money, he answers: “I was a bellboy. Carried people’s bags. First time I was tipped a nickel, I thought the world is a marvelous place. But a dime would be better.” Then a quarter. Well, you know how it works.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“My circumstances have changed,” he tells her. “There are things I won’t do anymore. You understand that, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There is what I know, what I suspect and what I don’t think I should ever hear,” she says in that lovely brogue. Margaret could recite her grocery list and it would sound like poetry.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Am I supposed to say I’m sorry?” he asks, genuinely.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s not in your nature,” she says. “All you did was offer. I’m the one who took.” (If only Carmela Soprano could have been so wise.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A song comes on the radio, and they dance, cheek to cheek, in the empty apartment. But before they can kiss, a real estate broker barges in to show a couple the apartment. As the couple look around, Nucky and Margaret exchange a most longing of longing looks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back down the road a bit at the Majestic, murder plans are being made. More gold curtains hang in the background.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Two shooters in public,” Luciano says, “so people know.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I want it all cleaned up before the meeting,” Lansky instructs Bugsy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Whom are they talking about? Who’s gonna get it now? Nucky? Narcisse? Johnny Torrio?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in A.C., Nucky is walking down the boardwalk with a big paper bag, looking around him as if he expects to get shot any second. A woman in a golden harem costume approaches and says, “Do you know who I am?” He guesses she’s a genie. She says she’s from the future and has a message for him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The only way to knowledge is through experience,” she says. Sister, we know all about it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She takes him over to a booth and pulls open a purple crushed velvet curtain and tells him not to be afraid. It’s dark inside. But something is lighting up. Is Nucky dreaming? And suddenly, it’s clear what’s before him. A television. A little post-modern inside joke from Terence Winter and his pals. You and I, lucky viewers, are firmly planted in the future. The future’s name is premium cable. Will Nucky invest his new-found fortune in the television industry?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We flash back to Nucky arriving at his parents’ home. His mom, Eleanor (Erin Dilly), has a black eye from his dad, Ethan (Ian Hart), who’s drunk again, practically passed out in the back yard with a shotgun. Nucky starts yelling at him, and Ethan points the gun. After a tense minute or so, Ethan breaks down.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You weren’t going to tell me,&#8221; he cries. &#8220;I’m going to be a grandfather, and you don’t want me to know. Is that what you think of me?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He hands the gun over, and as Nucky is taking the shells out, Ethan throws a punch. A fistfight ensues, which Nucky wins.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Touch our mother again, I’ll give you what you deserve,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Ethan has the last word. And it stings. “Wherever you think you’re running, we’re always gonna be right here.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in his current-day A.C., Nucky knocks on the door of a crummy building on the boardwalk above a cigar shop. Next door is Silver’s Bathhouse (enough gold!)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eli (Shea Whigham) answers the door. Nucky is holding that giant paper bag. What could be inside?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It seems there’s some sandwiches and some Cokes. Paint supplies sit behind them in this dingy little room. Yellow paint cans, of course. And containers of some household product called Gold Dust. Golden letters on the window behind their heads advertise tools and household supplies. But right behind Nucky, as he talks, we can see only two gold letters. And they spell out TV.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells Eli about his swim in the ocean. “First light  &#8212; haven’t done that in 45 years &#8230; farther than I ever dared as a kid. &#8216;Keep going,&#8217; I thought. &#8216;Keep going until you can’t turn back.&#8217; That’s where there isn’t any choice. You don’t know where that is. You don’t know until you pass it. And then it’s too late.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You never wanted to be here,” Eli tells him. “Not from the start.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells him they won’t be seeing each other again. “And I think that’s best. Don’t you?” he asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What am I supposed to do with myself?” Eli asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Aren’t you done with me telling you?” Nucky complains.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells him to go home. But Eli is afraid his wife won’t even open the door for him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“If you don’t try, you’ll always regret it,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“How come you got to be the wise one?” Eli asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Because you needed me to be.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s now that I realize there has been so much silence in this episode, more than any other before it. It’s giving us time to reflect. To think about what’s come before. Jimmy and Gillian, crazy Gyp Rosetti, Capone and his deaf kid, Van Alden and the baptism gone awry. I feel as if I’ve been through as much as Nucky and Eli.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Little brother,” Nucky says as he leaves. And they hug it out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eli goes over to the paper bag. What’s in there? Is it a gun? A statue of the Empire State Building? Gwyneth Paltrow’s head?  Ahhhh. It’s money, of course. Lots of it. Fistfuls and fistfuls.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And underneath?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A shaving brush and razor. The tools for Eli’s future.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We make a nice cut to Capone checking his scarred face in a compact mirror on his ride to the courthouse. The inside of Capone’s car is a golden hue. He sticks a cigar in his mouth and gets out, smiling. There are golden panels on the courthouse facade. The press crowds around, asking if he’ll beat the charges.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You hear they’re making a movie about me?” he laughs and poses for the cameras.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Who will take care of business while he’s away, they ask. He answers he has 500 men working for him, who will all be stranded “if this ship goes down.” At the top of the courthouse steps are D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi) and his partner. Capone stops smiling for a moment and tips his white hat.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the Majestic meeting with Luciano, the ceiling is amber. A golden mural and golden column shine in the background.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Our friend from Chicago couldn’t make it,” says Luciano to the mobsters gathered around his table. “We wish him well.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Pay your taxes, fellas,” one of the gangsters says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This table, its round for a reason &#8217;cause nobody sits at the head,” Luciano instructs. “There’s no boss.” There are seven bosses, a commission, made up from the five families in New York, plus Buffalo and Chicago. “Nobody gets made unless we all approve,” Luciano explains. “Your way of doing things, it’s over. If it’s good for business, it’s good for us.” Jews, Irish. No point in limiting their opportunities. “The future is ours, boys,” he says, and they toast, with glasses of golden Champagne.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dr. Narcisse walks out of a church after giving a sermon, his fans gathered around him and complimenting him. “One generation passeth away, another generation cometh … the sun rises and the sun goes down,” he says. And just then, two gunmen – Luciano’s guys – pop up and start shooting. Jeffrey Wright does a terrific stumbling death scene. But just to be sure, a gunman returns and shoots him one more time. For good measure.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At Gillian’s mental hospital, Nucky is being led in by the scary matron (Mary McCann), who says that they usually don’t tell patients they’re getting a visitor. It creates an expectation that can lead to difficulties. But Gillian (Gretchen Mol) is an exception.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“She’s a model girl, so we let her know she would be having a visitor,&#8221; the matron says. &#8220;She’s been preparing all day.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian is seated on a white wicker chair, in a pink-and-white checked dress, looking like the adolescent in those flashbacks. Nucky leaps right in and wipes away any hopes she might have of escape.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Whatever you want, whatever you think I’ll do, that won’t be possible,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You were very clever. You made a bargain. You saved your own neck. That’s more than other people can say.” Gillian is not responding. She’s playing with a ladybug crawling on her fingers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky flails around in a one-way conversation. “I’m not someone you should look to for help. I’m leaving here. Starting something new. I won’t be back. You’ll have your own room inside, that’s been arranged. If you get yourself out, there’ll be money in a trust account. Don’t write me. Don’t try to find me. Don’t look for anything else.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian won’t fight back. But she’s tearing up</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You want me on my knees?” he asks, desperate for some feedback. “I won’t do that. The past is past. Nothing can change it.” Is he trying to convince Gillian or himself? Remember your Faulkner: The past is never dead. It’s not even past.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What do you expect of me?” Nucky pleads.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian is still looking at the bug. “They’re called ladybugs. But how can you tell which one’s a lady?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The matron comes back over. She asks if Gillian enjoyed her visit.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Oh yes,” she says, graciously.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She moves to get up, then doubles over. “It’s a bit tender,” Gillian says, holding her abdomen. Oh no. They’ve already done the hysterectomy! Nucky was too late.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Dr. Cotton will give you something,” the matron says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She puts out her hand to Nucky, and he looks alarmed. But then he helps her up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There’s still graciousness in the world,” she says, and walks away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We cut to the Old Rumpus, where even the showgirls are dressed in glittering gold undergarments. Nucky walks in and says he’s here for his things. In his bedroom, with its brown and golden shimmering wallpaper, is an empty suitcase. He looks through a desk drawer and pulls out a book stuffed with documents and insurance policies. (Is Mickey’s in there?) But it’s not the policy he’s after. It’s the postcard from Mabel from when they were kids. He turns it over and reads it. And the phone rings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s the manager from the Ritz. “I have a situation that needs your attention.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Nucky is on the crowded boardwalk. King Neptune is making his way down in a small parade, children wearing golden crowns. The Commodore is on the porch. Gillian (Madeleine Rose Yen) is one of Neptune’s attendants. Nucky spots her. She runs, but he catches up with her.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She asks what’s happened to his face. (His eye is blackened from the fistfight with his dad.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You’re not the only one who doesn’t like where she’s come from,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You have Mrs. Thompson,&#8221; she replies. &#8220;You’re going to have a family.” She asks him to just leave her alone. “Mrs. Thompson said you want to be good, but you don’t know how.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jim Neary comes and fetches Nucky and says the Commodore wants him up on the porch. This young Nucky asks Gillian – with his best Buscemi impersonation – to stay for a moment. Please. He tenderly touches her arm.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back to current-day A.C. The manager is telling Nucky that the guy they’ve caught is a polite kid. A pretty lousy thief. He’s talking about Joe Harper (Travis Tope), who’s being held in the hotel basement. Nucky springs him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flashback again. (They’re coming fast and furious now, headed for an awful collision of past and present.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Commodore demands Nucky’s badge. They argue. “I don’t have faith in you,” the Commodore says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I served you. I’ve waited. I’ve kept my mouth shut.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You think you deserve something for trying hard. Through me and from me, that’s all there is.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Nucky lecturing Joe Harper on the boardwalk. He asks where the $1,000 is that he gave him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’ll earn it back,” Joe says. God, he sounds just like Jimmy. Oh. My. God. He sounds just like Jimmy. It is suddenly dawning on me. &#8230;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Joe says he’ll work at the club.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The war’s over,” Nucky says. “The other side won. I can’t help you. Go back home.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I don’t have one.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Then go find one. Make one. Do without one. Don’t take it out on everyone else.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky sticks money in the kid’s top jacket pocket.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Joe takes the money out and rips it up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“O.K., kid. You showed me. Good luck. You’re gonna need it.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flashback to Nucky, devastated, walking off the Commodore’s porch. He’s walking away. Walk, Nucky! Keep walking! But Leander walks up to him. “There is a youth the Commodore wishes to place in service,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What’s that got to do with me?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The task is entrusted to the sheriff,” he says, showing him the badge.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky looks up at the porch, and the Commodore is staring over at him, then turns his gaze to Gillian, who’s still standing on the boardwalk, waiting for Nucky to come back.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You understand this is an act of charity,” Leander says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But this is the moment. The moment that Nucky talked about earlier in the episode, the event that this whole damn show hinges on, without which the future – for Jimmy, for Gillian, for Nucky, Eli and everyone in their orbit – would have been so very different. Without this moment, there would have been no bad Nucky perhaps. And certainly no Jimmy. And no Richard Harrow. This is the pivotal moment that will seal their fate. Our fate of sitting here in TV land, witnessing it all. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is that point, the one you don’t see coming until it’s right in front of you and you have to make that snap judgment, the one that will change your life forever. “You don’t know where that is. You don’t know until you pass it. And then it’s too late,” Nucky told Eli about swimming too far out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And you know that Nucky is about to swim past that point of no return. Trading Gillian for his future life of crime. And gold.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back to the present, Nucky is walking along the boardwalk and notices a sign over one of the buildings, featuring King Neptune. A bunch of drunk students (Princeton boys, with the orange P on their sweaters) are making their way down the boardwalk and run smack into Nucky. One of them is reciting a Robert W. Service poem about – you guessed it! – the gold rush.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our lesson, fellow premium cable watchers:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>“I wanted the gold, and I sought it;<br />
I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.<br />
Was it famine or scurvy &#8212; I fought it;<br />
I hurled my youth into a grave.<br />
I wanted the gold, and I got it &#8212;<br />
Came out with a fortune last fall, &#8212;<br />
Yet somehow life’s not what I thought it,<br />
And somehow the gold isn’t all.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flashback to Gillian, standing on the boardwalk. “Is something wrong?” she asks Nucky. “Do we have to leave? Can I go down to the beach?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You wanted to sail around the world,” he says to her mournfully.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Don’t you?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flash ahead. Joe is standing behind Nucky. “When Mee-ma talked about you,” he says, “I couldn’t tell if it was love or hate.” Mee-ma? “Grandma,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flashback. Nucky tells Gillian that there’s a man here who’s very rich. “He’s offered to help us both. Would you like to meet him? I promise I’ll always look after you.” He puts his hand out to Gillian.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Who are you?” Nucky asks Joe Harper.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Tommy Darmody.” Gasp!!!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Tommy (not Joe Harper! It was a Twainian made-up name!!!) pulls out a gun. And he shoots Nucky twice. Nucky falls and puts out his hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Young Gillian puts out her hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Tommy shoots Nucky in the face, the bullet neatly piercing his cheek. He’s still alive. Dazed but alive. Detectives grab Tommy and show their badges to Nucky and say something inaudible about taking him to the hospital.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And now Nucky is swimming under water as a boy, from that first scene from the first episode this season. He’s chasing the gold coin. And finally he catches it. And we fade to black.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The end of a small, gilded masterpiece.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Questions and talking points for those of us who now have nothing to do on Sunday nights:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So is Nucky dead or alive? I vote alive. But then again, I was sure Tony didn’t get rubbed out in that last scene of &#8220;The Sopranos.&#8221; Call me an optimist.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In real life, Nucky was not shot. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_L._Johnson">He died in 1968</a> at 85 at the Atlantic County Convalescent Home.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone went to prison at age 33, where he was diagnosed with syphilis and suffering from cocaine withdrawal. Neurosyphilis ate at his brain until he was released in 1939 and found to have the I.Q. of a 12-year-old. In 1947 he had a stroke, then contracted pneumonia and died of a heart attack just after his 48th birthday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Majestic, Luciano’s luxury apartment building, has been the home of Milton Berle, Conan O’Brien, Walter Winchell and Marc Jacobs. Vincent (the Chin) Gigante, the mobster who later wore his bathrobe and slippers on the streets of Greenwich Village, shot Frank Costello in the lobby back in 1957, but Costello lived. When he delivered the shot, Gigante said, “This is for you, Frank,” which caused Costello to turn his head, resulting in a mere scalp wound.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe we should all rent Louis Malle’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsPiWrlaLAI">“Atlantic City”</a> next week and get together to chat …</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Season 5, Episode 7: <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire#/boardwalk-empire/episodes/05/55-friendless-child/index.html">‘Friendless Child’</a></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>“The truly terrible thing is that everyone has his reasons.”</em><br />
– Jean Renoir</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The penultimate episode of &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; begins with Willie’s boss, the United States attorney Robert Hodge, delivering a radio broadcast on NBC. “We are at war against an army of hoodlums who have made our streets unsafe for decent people,” he says, as front pages from New York’s newspapers and photos of actual gangster slayings (including some from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weegee">Weegee</a>) flash across the screen in black and white. We’re reminded that many of these people were real &#8212; the murderers, the maniacs.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s a turf war going on, as we know from last week’s windup. In a montage, one by one we see our &#8220;Boardwalk&#8221; versions of these characters: Luciano (Vincent Piazza), Maranzano (Giampiero Judica), Lansky (Anatol Yusef), doors opening and each of them looking alarmed, worried they’re going to be the next to get a bullet to the brain.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We get a brief shot of Willie (Ben Rosenfield) in Hodge’s office. We thought he was out, but they’re pulling him back in. Uh oh.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We cut to Nucky’s office in black and white, and quickly switch to color, as he pours himself a drink but decides against it, throwing his cigarette butt into the glass. He’s about to have a meeting at the Old Rumpus with Maranzano. And Nucky’s in a bad mood. He yells at Maranzano that there are 19 men dead between them and at least a million dollars in lost revenue and tells him he needs to go after Luciano.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maranzano urges him to stay calm, that Luciano will make a mistake. But then Mickey (Paul Sparks) delivers some new tidbit: Two of their trucks have been firebombed, nearly “a hundred grand up in smoke.” Maranzano asks if they can get help from Nucky’s friend in Chicago, but Nucky says Capone has cut him off.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maranzano says he’ll send more men to guard Nucky’s trucks, and he gets up to leave. The new kid, Joe Harper (Travis Tope), tells him he’s cleaned off his windshield for him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Maranzano is gone, Mickey gives Harper a revolver. But Nucky objects. “You’re not part of this, understand?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harper actually sounds a lot like Jimmy Darmody. If you close your eyes when he talks, you’d think it was the actor Michael Pitt. Which explains Nucky’s protective impulse.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells Mickey to take Archie (Paul Calderón) and Sean (Nicholas Calhoun) and head to New York City. Nucky’s got his own plan.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Bugsy Siegel (Michael Zegen), who’s back in his old Brooklyn neighborhood. (He was from Williamsburg. What would he think of it now? Its hipster bars and vinyl record shops, luxury hotels and flea markets?) A woman answers the door, and when Bugsy asks where her husband is, she says the racetrack. They start kissing. So Bugsy’s having an affair with someone’s wife. Though we don’t know whose wife. We know it’s not Luciano’s wife, because this woman is Jewish, with a mezuza on the door frame. You’re just waiting for the husband to walk through that door. But in real life, Bugsy didn’t buy it until 1947.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We flash back to old Atlantic City and Gillian as a girl, taking a piece of Black Jack chewing gum off Nucky’s desk and picking up her copy of Nellie Bly’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Around-World-Days-Nellie-Bly-ebook/dp/B004A8ZUC6">&#8220;Around the World in 72 Days.&#8221;</a> Her face is dirty, her red hair greasy. Nucky (Marc Pickering) walks in and makes her spit the gum out. He takes the book and looks inside. On the inside cover, she’s written in script “From the library of Gillian Darmody.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When he asks where her family is, she tells him it’s rude to ask personal questions – just like the grown-up Gillian would. He offers to help her. She gives him her address: 915 Haddon Avenue.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s no Haddon Avenue in Atlantic City, he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s in Trenton, she says. An orphanage. (In reality, there’s no 915 Haddon Avenue in Trenton either. It’s in Camden and is now <a href="http://www.use.salvationarmy.org/use/www_use_camdenkroc.nsf">a Salvation Army center</a>, though a century ago it was the Camden Home for Friendless Children.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in our present world – 1931 – Willie is unhappily pulling files for his boss, Hodge, who has unofficially demoted him to clerk. His associate, a young woman who also works for Hodge, sympathizes but tells him, “This is all a little sensitive given your family background.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A call comes in for him. And though only mumbles can be heard on the other end, we know it’s Eli by the look on Willie’s face.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We flash back again to Nucky and his wife, Mabel (Maya Kazan), in their kitchen. Gillian is staying with them. When Mabel asks Nucky why she ran off, he says he doesn’t know. “She must have a reason,” Mabel says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Everyone has a reason,” Nucky says. “Murderers have reasons.” Which, of course, is the theme of the season: the back story to why Nucky is here. Why Gillian is in the insane asylum.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mabel wants Gillian to stay with them. But Nucky says he will take her back to the orphanage in the morning. Mabel is upset. “What do you want from me?” he asks. “I’m trying to do the right thing here.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bugsy’s rendezvous has come to an end; the girlfriend looks out the door to make sure the coast is clear. Bugsy leaves, kissing his fingers and touching the mezuza.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On the way down the tenement stairs, Bugsy bumps into the woman’s husband, Morris, who is thrilled to see his old friend, now a gangster celebrity. Bugsy lies and says he’s collecting from one of the guys in the building. Morris asks him for an autograph for his wife, Talia, who comes out to chat. Suddenly, the hallway door bursts open and Sean starts shooting at Bugsy, who uses Morris as a shield. Archie yells out that they want him alive.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They chase him into Morris and Talia’s apartment. There’s a heated struggle on a fire escape, but wrestling back inside, Bugsy manages to stick a gun in Sean’s mouth and blow the back of his head off. Archie grabs Bugsy, puts a knife to his throat and drags him down stairs by his ear. Bugsy knows exactly whom he’s dealing with and asks what he’s done with Tonino’s ear. Morris, still alive, is whimpering on the stairs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Mabel brings Gillian out in a pretty pink-and-white dress, her hair combed, her face cleaned. “I wish to make amends … for the things I stole,” Gillian says. She’ll help around the house, help at school. But Nucky insists, privately with Mabel, that Gillian can’t stay and has to go back to Trenton. They don’t have the room, the money or the right, he says. But Mabel won’t take no for an answer and says she’ll find her “a situation &#8212; girls are always needed.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to a meeting between John Torrio (Greg Antonacci), Lansky and Luciano. The phone rings, and it’s Bugsy, who is tied to a chair, a bullet wound in his leg. He tells them that he’s in Atlantic City and has been kidnapped. Thinking he’s joking around, Luciano hangs up on him. But Nucky calls back and confirms the kidnapping.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He puts Bugsy on the line. “They took me to see diving horse and everything,&#8221; he tells Luciano. &#8220;Later on we’re getting cotton candy.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky gets back on the line and says he wants a meeting. But Luciano says he’ll meet him at his funeral.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You’ll go to Siegel’s before mine,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Interesting proposition &#8212; let me think it over,” Luciano says and hangs up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bugsy says he has to call his wife, Esther, so she doesn’t worry, then yaks on and on and on about being a father in a couple of weeks, about cheating on his wife.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The phone rings, and Nucky grabs it, assuming it’s Luciano, asking him what he’s decided. But it’s Margaret. Bugsy is really making a racket in the background, so she asks what’s going on. Nucky says they’re rehearsing an act downstairs. To shut Bugsy up, Archie knocks him out with a sap.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Margaret tells Nucky his order has been confirmed to short 50,000 shares of the Mayflower Grain Corporation. He asks her to short another 50 grand. But the market will notice, she says. That’s the point, he says, before telling her to take a short position herself. Bugsy, meanwhile, is waking up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I have to go,” Nucky says. “They’re rehearsing again.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Willie is on the street outside a courthouse (on Monroe Place in Brooklyn Heights, where our pediatrician’s office is!). He sees Eli (Shea Whigham), who looks like a bum. Willie won’t even shake his hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I screwed up,” Eli says. “Got in over my head.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Pop, whatever it is, I can’t hear it, you understand?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Willie tells him to meet him tonight at his apartment. “Clean yourself up, get something to eat, and we’ll sort it out,” Willie says. He offers him some money, but Eli refuses.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What is it you want?” Willie asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I told myself if he’s doing O.K., it was worth it. And here you are, the right side of the street. That’s all.” He walks away, and Willie calls after him. Suddenly a car pulls up, and a couple of men drag Willie inside, putting a satchel over his head.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“One never knows the capacity of an ordinary hand satchel until …” In a flashback at Nucky’s place, Gillian reads aloud from &#8220;Around the World in 72 Days&#8221; about Bly’s living out of just such a satchel on her journey. Then Gillian stops reading.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Don’t take me back,” she begs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Who’s going to look after you?” Nucky asks. Gillian says she’ll be like Bly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You can’t live out of a satchel,” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Nelly did,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“But she came home,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She offers to help Mabel when the baby comes. “She’s scared,” Gillian says. “You can see it. … Please let me stay.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She tells Nucky about the orphanage, how they lock you in a room, with no food or water, and tell you that your whole life is a sin. “You can never wash it away &#8212; I didn’t do anything,” she starts to cry.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s a knock at the door. It’s Sheriff Lindsay (Boris McGiver), who asks Nucky to come with him, that he’s needed on county business. He looks pretty grim. (Stay home, Nucky!) Mabel says she’ll look after her “niece,” who’s visiting from Camden.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We jump back to Nucky’s current office, Bugsy loudly singing a dirty song about his girlfriend’s cat, except he doesn’t use the word cat.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mickey pleads for someone to shut him up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells them to put a gag on him. “Make it tight.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly, after seven years on the lam, Eli shows up, struggling with the bodyguards to get in the door. “You better have a goddamn good reason for being anywhere near me,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to the satchel being pulled off Willie’s head by Luciano’s man Pinky. Lansky and Luciano have kidnapped Willie, naturally. Luciano asks if he knows who he is. Willie runs down a list of all his aliases. And Lansky’s as well. He thinks Pinky is Bugsy. But they correct him and tell him he’s not here right now.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Sooner or later, you’re all going to jail,” Willie says. (He should try to be a little nicer to them, I think, biting my thumbnail. I never really liked this kid. But I don’t want him shot in the head. Or stabbed with a statue of the Empire State Building. Or hit in the head with a machete. Or … oh, never mind.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I got no beef with you,” Luciano says. “Whatever your uncle does to Benny [a.k.a. Bugsy], that’s gotta reflect on you.”<br />
Willie says he’s got nothing to do with Nucky, that he works for the United States attorney. But Pinky contradicts him by choking Willie with his own necktie. (Yet another new way to murder someone on “Boardwalk Empire”!) This goes on for a good 30 seconds or so. Willie’s eyes bulge. But Luciano calls Pinky off.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We’ll go over your job history a little bit later, O.K.?” Luciano says. The phone rings, and it’s Nucky. Lansky answers. “You and your boss have crossed a line,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I am my own boss, Mr. Thompson,” Lansky says. Nucky demands to talk to Luciano, then asks to talk to Willie. But Luciano tells him they’ll talk in person.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back to Sheriff Lindsay and Nucky, his deputy, outside the Commodore’s mansion. Lindsay is explaining how he ended up working for the Commodore. (Everyone has his reasons.) How the Commodore told him he needed a reliable man. Did one thing for him. Then another.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You said you wanted to help &#8212; here is opportunity,” Lindsay says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Aren’t you coming?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I believe I’m done,” the sheriff says, taking his badge off and handing it to Nucky. He rides off in his carriage.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leander is standing on the stairs, as Nucky walks into the mansion, a real Charles Foster Kane scenario. Paintings and sculptures in crates. Crystal chandelier tinkling. Nucky looks around, wide-eyed and a bit scared. He tells Leander the sheriff was feeling poorly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This is a private concern,” Leander explains. “It goes without saying that discretion is paramount.” The Commodore (John Ellison Conlee) comes out of a room, pulling up one suspender.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ugh.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Conduct yourself with honor, and we’ll discuss what happens next,” the Commodore says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leander explains that the Commodore performs charitable acts for the community, enlisting children in service, schooling them in the domestic arts. But sometimes things don’t work out. Inside the room is a little girl, shaking with fear, her arms crossed tightly in front of her. He instructs Nucky to bring her home and tell her mother that no more money will be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’m thinking, Grab the girl, Nucky, and run. And never come back. But everyone has his reasons. And we know the story that follows. Which leads here, eventually, to the next scene.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A cadre of armed men stand before a small fleet of cars with headlights on. Mickey asks Nucky what he gets for sticking around. Nucky asks him what he wants. The club, a clear title and 5 percent of everything else. Nucky agrees.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I didn’t think you’d say yes,” Mickey says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You caught me in a good mood,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He asks Eli if he has a gun. “I don’t even have cigarettes,” Eli says. Luciano’s men step out of the cars, fully armed, with Willie, his hands tied behind him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The hostage swap is about to begin. Nucky tells everyone to put the guns down, and Bugsy is sent over to the other side, his hands tied behind him as well. Willie begins to walk over. Bugsy limps over, then gets his hands free and punches Willie in the face. Guns are drawn, and Eli lunges for Bugsy. “You’re gonna get us all killed,” Nucky says to Eli, his arms wrapped tight around him. Luciano’s men take Willie back.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bugsy yells that they’ll bury Nucky and his whole family.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We had an agreement,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This is business,” Luciano says. “And I want all of yours.” The club, Cuba, everything.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mickey gets nervous and tries to reason with Luciano about the club. But Luciano lifts his gun and shoots Mickey in the throat. You knew he had it coming. Mickey has pretty much had it coming since the first time he appeared. They all draw their guns, and shots ring out. Total chaos. Archie goes down. (Aw, I liked him. Who will get his nifty ear collection?) Nucky runs to the middle of the fray and yells for everyone to stop shooting.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s yours &#8212; everything’s yours,” Nucky says. “Let him go.” (Little do they know what we suspect, that Nucky is about to make a killing in the stock market.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano asks Lansky what he thinks. “I think I’d like to see him on his knees.” (This is payoff for the time Nucky had Lansky on his knees and nearly executed him.) So Nucky gets down on his knees.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Now you know how it feels,” Lansky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I underestimated you,” Nucky says to Luciano. “You’re much smarter than I gave you credit for.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“And what’s that make you?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Dumber than I knew.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Good words for the headstone,” Luciano says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bugsy urges Luciano to just kill him, kill Willie, “Kill ’em all, grab it anyway,” he says. You half expect another verse about his girlfriend’s cat.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“That won’t solve your problem,” Nucky says. His problem with Maranzano.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’ll get to him,” Luciano says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Unless he gets to you first.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells him to give him 24 hours to take care of it. “I take the risk. And you let him go.” He nods toward his nephew. Lansky whispers something to Luciano, who puts the gun down. They shove Willie back in the car.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You deliver,” Luciano says, “and we deliver.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They drive off as Eli asks, “What’d you just do?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I don’t know,” Nucky answers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to agent D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi) and his associate, telling a judge that Capone made over a million between 1925 and 1929 and paid no taxes. They have him on 22 counts of willful evasion of income taxes. They can trace the money; they have a witness and can put him in jail. The judge agrees to give them a warrant.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is interspersed with eight feds walking up a big stairway, then down a hallway. They authoritatively walk into an office and announce they have a subpoena. For Salvatore Maranzano. Huh?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maranzano gets up from his desk, but instead of being handed a subpoena, he is stabbed in the gut, then in the back, then in the front again. He grabs a small statue of a Roman soldier sitting on his desk and falls onto the floor of his office, face up, just like in the Internet photos of his real corpse.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Someone shoots him in the forehead to finish the job. The shooter is Eli.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Willie is thrown out of a car, still alive but rumpled and bloody, outside the courthouse. “Where the heck have you been?” his female co-worker asks. “Maybe I shouldn’t ask.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She tells him to get cleaned up. Maranzano, she says, was murdered this afternoon in his office.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No kidding.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, Luciano and Lansky and Torrio are meeting again, to decide how to divvy up the spoils. Luciano says to give A.C. to Pinky. Torrio tries to get in on organizing meetings and changes, but they tell him they’ll handle it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bugsy, with a black eye, has already started celebrating, flanked by a couple of pretty molls. “This is gonna be a good year, Charlie,” Lansky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Joe Harper comes into Nucky’s office and asks if he can clean up. He tells him to take out the empties and take out all the booze. “Do you know what happened?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You won.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Mickey, Arquimedes, they’re not coming back, understand?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Is the club staying open?” Harper asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Ask the new boss.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harper tells him there are things he can do for him. “You can sweep the sand,” Nucky says, in a reference to his own beginnings on the Commodore’s porch. He gives Harper $1000. “Go be a plumber or a bookkeeper or the president. Just take the money.&#8221; Harper takes the money and walks out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Nucky comes in late from his creepy new pedophile’s assistant job. Mabel is making another pie.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Business took longer than I expected,” he says. Yuck.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mabel is agitated. Gillian ran away while she was asleep.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He asks if she took anything with her. But Mabel is angry and asks what he said to her to make her leave. Nucky doesn’t know anything about it. “She is a thief,” he cries.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“She was someone who needed help,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I care about you. I care about the family we’re going to have together … You can’t fix everything.” Mabel runs off and slams the door.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We cut to Nucky now and the letter from Gillian with the return address of Nellie Bly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He sits down and finally opens it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Dear Sheriff Enoch: You came to my aid once a very long time ago,” Gretchen Mol reads. “I only did what I had to do to survive, making a devil’s bargain. … For the past seven years, I have been held captive. I feel as I am in hell … taken away one piece at a time. … Show me the kindness now you once showed an orphan girl under the boardwalk.” She writes that he is the only one left who knows her. She asks him to save her.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And suddenly, she’s a young redheaded girl on the boardwalk in the dress Mabel once gave her. “Please help me,” she pleads.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Questions and talking points before the end of the world:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">O.K. So this is it, folks. We only have a handful of fictional characters who can buy the farm in the series finale. Who will it be? Eli, Gillian, Joe Harper (who, by the way, is the name of Tom Sawyer’s friend)?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What new mantelpiece ornament/appliance/cooking implement/garden tool will be used as a murder weapon next week?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Nucky help Gillian get out of the insane asylum? Or is he too busy right now?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Nucky retire on the killing he makes on the stock market? (Shades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_le_flambeur">&#8220;Bob le Flambeur.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Mabel die in the next and final episode? In childbirth? Suicide?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, most important, what will we all do and talk about after next Sunday night?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Season 5, Episode 6: <a href="http://www.hbo.com/#/schedule/detail/Boardwalk+Empire+54:+Devil+You+Know/600059">‘Devil You Know’</a></strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We open where we left off last week on &#8220;Boardwalk Empire,&#8221; with Chalky (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Daughter Maitland (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Margot-Bingham-Boardwalk-Empires-Daughter-Maitland/558876537493668">Margot Bingham</a>) staring at each other, as a girl of about 7 years old lies on a couch in the Harlem whorehouse of Dr. Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright). Chalky asks, after that long look, what Daughter’s doing there.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Waiting. For business, she answers. Does this mean she’s a prostitute?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You need to go. Now,” she says. The little girl is not Narcisse’s, she adds.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Then whose?” Chalky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Just mine.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s a knock at the door. One of Narcisse’s men asks why the door is locked and says that the doctor is coming. Daughter says she’s changing her clothes, and the bodyguard tells her to unlock the door when she’s done.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Walk out while you can,” she pleads with Chalky. But he takes the key out of the door and leaves it locked.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Let’s both see him,” he says. Welcome to the “Boardwalk Empire” version of Sartre’s “No Exit.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to the Old Rumpus. Joe Harper, the new kid, is sent by Mickey (Paul Sparks) to bring Nucky (Steve Buscemi) and Archie (Paul Calderon), the bodyguard, some sandwiches. (The bodyguard’s full name is Arquimedes, but a few episodes back he told Margaret his name was Archie.) When Harper gets upstairs, Archie is asleep in a chair. He wakes up and opens his switchblade on reflex, then realizes it’s just Harper and knocks on Nucky’s bedroom door. No answer. The bed is empty. Archie runs out in a panic. Where did he go?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We segue to another bed of Nucky’s from years ago in a flashback to 1897. The young deputy sheriff (Marc Pickering) rises in the middle of the night to find his young pregnant wife, Mabel (<a href="http://www.mayakazan.com/bio/">Maya Kazan</a>, granddaughter of the director Elia Kazan, and also starring in “The Knick”), in the kitchen making a strawberry pie. He asks her why she can’t leave it till morning. The strawberries are starting to turn.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells her about a meeting he was at until late, with speech after speech, then complains about having to appoint Jim Neary an alderman. (Years later, Nucky will have Neary killed for planning to testify against him. The murder is nicely juxtaposed with Nucky’s wedding to Margaret in Season 2, a scene straight out of the “Godfather: Part II.”) He doesn’t like how Neary calls him Nucky, which is humiliating. Mabel teases him about the nickname. He says the Commodore never even calls him by name. She says he will get his recognition.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Doesn’t matter,” he says. “I have you. I’m going to be a father. I’ll make my way. I know what I’m doing it for.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Nucky in 1931 at a dive bar, drowning his sorrows over Sally’s death. This place is a real dump. Nucky could be in any bar in New York or New Jersey right now, but he chooses to slum it at this claustrophobic hell hole &#8212; maybe to punish himself for what has happened to Sally. (And to further our “No Exit” theme.) After lighting a cigar for a barfly in a red dress, he tells her his name is Francis X. Bushman. (Francis X. Bushman is yet another “Boardwalk” inside joke. Bushman was a silent film matinee idol known for his sculpted body.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The dumb brunette (or maybe she’s not so dumb) doesn’t get the reference, and she pegs Nucky as an unhappily married, sexually frustrated businessman. “I sell floor polish,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, Van Alden (Michael Shannon) and Eli (Shea Whigham) are making their way down the hall to Al Capone’s office, where they have to somehow steal the ledgers for D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi) and the feds. “If we run now, how’s D’Angelo gonna know?” Eli asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Run where, with what?” Van Alden says. (“No Exit”!)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Outside the door, they discuss how they’re going to manage to snatch the ledgers out of the safe using the satchel they’re carrying.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This has not been thought through,” Van Alden says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of Capone’s boys opens the door and sees them standing out there and offers to take the satchel of cash. They insist on bringing it to the count room themselves. But the guy says he doesn’t have the key to the locked room.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eli waltzes in and says he’ll try the door knob. “If it’s open, it’s open &#8212; right?” It’s open. But Capone’s brother, Ralph (Domenick Lombardozzi), is having sex on the desk in there. Eli closes the door.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An agitated Ralph emerges and asks them what they’re doing. He takes the satchel and opens it, then turns it over. Cut-up newspaper flutters out. Gulp. “Go find Mike D’Angelo,” he says. Phew.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Narcisse’s place, Daughter pats her sleeping child’s head and pleads with Chalky to let her take the girl out of there before Narcisse shows up and the showdown begins. (You know somebody’s gonna get it in this scenario. Please, Howard Korder, don’t let it be the kid.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“So you can book off again?” Chalky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I knew I had to leave or never be free,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You free now?” he asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky tells her that the only thing that would get him to sleep these past seven years was hearing her voice in his head. But after a while, he didn’t remember what she sounded like. “Just made you up.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The little girl wakes up, and Chalky goes over to chat with her. She was born in Oklahoma, she says, but has been all over. Her mother doesn’t sing but works for a white man in Memphis, cleaning his house.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly, Narcisse is at the door, demanding that Daughter unlock it. “It’s a long way to travel for foolish games,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky gives her the go ahead, and Daughter gets her daughter to move to the back of the room with her doll. Narcisse walks in, and he’s greeted by Chalky and his gun. But he coolly calls off his bodyguards and closes the door.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narcisse walks over to the girl. It’s his turn to chat with her. She tells him her name is Althea, which, he explains, means “healing” in ancient Greek. He asks if she knows Chalky.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“They ain’t a part of this,” Chalky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Well, I suppose we all have our affairs to discuss,” Narcisse says, creepily taking Althea’s hand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Nucky walks into a cigar shop on the boardwalk. While the owner tells him of a “dirty little monkey” who’s been stealing from him and other businesses in the area, Nucky watches as a young girl walks up onto the Commodore’s porch. The Commodore (John Ellison Conlee) brings her inside while the mother stands outside, nervously wringing her hands. Is this Gillian as a girl, about to be molested by the Commodore? But her hair is brown, not red. Is the Commodore a pedophile?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The cigar shop owner makes his payoff to Nucky and wants to know what he’s getting in return. “I vow to bring that rascal to justice,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We’re back in the dive bar with Nucky in the present. Now there are three of them (“No Exit”!), joined by the barfly’s female friend. The two women laugh while Nucky tries to recite <a href="http://www.hwlongfellow.org/poems_poem.php?pid=62">“The Song of Hiawatha,”</a> the epic poem by Longfellow he had to memorize as a boy. He loses his train of thought and takes a drink. “Worst booze in New Jersey,” one of the women says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells them he can get the good stuff at the Ritz-Carlton, where he knows people. “I know them, but I’m not like them,” he says. “You start at the bottom with nothing, you have nothing … Get yourself ahead. For what, though? For what? No one ever asks what’s the point?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A drunk across the room tells him to shut up. A barroom brawl ensues, naturally, and Nucky beats him to a pulp.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly, “Hiawatha” comes back to Nucky. Then he tells the women he wants to have sex with them (except he doesn’t use the word sex). So much for childhood memorization.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Capone’s office, D’Angelo walks in and smacks Van Alden across his giant, craggy face. Eli attempts to explain, with some coaching from D’Angelo: We came to rob the joint. We knew the big boy would be out. Skeleton crew. Figured it would be easy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Where did you geniuses get that idea?” D’Angelo asks. (You!)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“My wife,” Van Alden says. “We’re having trouble at home.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I can vouch for that,” Eli says. Ha!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ralph tells D’Angelo to get rid of them. But on their way out, Capone (Stephen Graham) walks in with Paul Muni and George Raft, who are making a crime picture set in Chicago. (1932’s “Scarface.”)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone asks D’Angelo what’s up and decides to take matters into his own hands.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We flash back to Nucky talking to a young Eli (Ryan Dinning), who is asking him to get him a city job. Nucky spots the “dirty little monkey” – the kid who’s been ripping everyone off, selling loosies on the boardwalk. He chases him under the boardwalk but loses him. Buried in a box in the sand is the kid’s stash: <a href="http://www.oldtimecandy.com/walk-the-candy-aisle/black-jack-gum/">Black Jack gum</a>, cigarettes, apples, toys.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Chicago, Capone is running his hands through the newspaper from the satchel. “This really hurts my feelings,” he says. He reminds Eli that he took him in when he was down. And says to Van Alden, “I thought we was buddies.” He thinks they’re up to something more than just plain robbery, though. Capone pulls out a gun, tells Van Alden he thinks he’s a fed and puts the gun to his head.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Al, you got your guests,” D’Angelo says, reminding him of the actors in the next room, but really just trying to save his two plants.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Turn up the radio, Ralphie,” Capone advises.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Van Alden knocks the gun away and attacks Capone, climbs on top of him on the desk and really loses it. “I am a sworn agent of the United States Treasury,” he screams. “I swear by Jesus, our Lord, justice will reign down upon you …” And it seems for a moment that Van Alden’s crazy fed routine may just be the only thing to get them out of this mess. Until D’Angelo blows a hole in that big head of his. Ouch.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone is covered in Van Alden’s blood, and for a change, he is pretty shaken up. “He was gonna kill me,” a rattled Capone says. He’s thinking aloud about Van Alden’s nearly decade-long ruse. “All this time …” he says. Unbelieving.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells Eli to “spill it.” So Eli says they were told by a fed to grab the ledger books. When Capone asks for a name, Eli waits a beat, and D’Angelo looks tense. Will he shoot Eli in the head, too, before he fingers him? But Eli says the guy is Ness.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a rare moment of reflection, the still shaken Capone says to Raphie, “We was barbers … we would be asleep now.” (Capone’s father was a barber from Southern Italy.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone tells D’Angelo to take Eli out and finish him off. “What do we tell his brother?” Ralph asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Luciano’s taking care of him,” Capone says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As D’Angelo takes Eli out (past the now rattled Raft and Muni), Ralph hands him the ledger books in the satchel and tells him to run them over to Cicero when he’s done with Eli. To be safe. Score!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After getting off the elevator, Eli asks D’Angelo what happens to him now. D’Angelo says (in premium cable terms) that he doesn’t care, throws a rolled up bill at him and tells him to buy a bus ticket.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Just as Nucky is about to have sex with one of the women, the other one smashes him across the face with a heavy object and knocks him out. The top gangster in Atlantic City has been out-gangstered by a couple of swindlers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the bodyguards gather outside the locked door, Chalky asks why Daughter has come to Narcisse’s place. She opens a suitcase and pulls out a record, then explains that she paid for the studio, musicians and the pressing but that no one will hire her to sing anywhere in the country because of Narcisse. “You are drowning me,” she says to the doctor. “Drop by drop.” She gets down on her knees and begs him to let her go.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narcisse ignores her and says that he’s just come from a meeting with Luciano (Vincent Piazza), who is forcing him to pay protection.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Ain’t no concern of mine,” Chalky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What if it were?” Narcisse asks. “Am I worse than those devils who betrayed you?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You the only devil I know,” Chalky says, gesturing with his gun.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells Chalky he will hire him at a good price. “Every soul in this room yearns to be free,” Narcisse says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Put the record on,” Chalky orders.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narcisse puts it on, and out comes Daughter’s lovely voice singing “Dream a Little Dream of Me” – a brand-new song back in 1931. Chalky listens and looks like he may cry. I may cry.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky takes the needle off the record and says he’ll accept Narcisse’s offer under the condition that he stop blacklisting Daughter. “You came to be heard,” Chalky tells Daughter. “That’s your voice.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narcisse agrees and tells her to pick a city. He’ll make a call, and she’ll be booked tomorrow.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Daughter protests and tells Chalky that Narcisse can’t be trusted. But Chalky says he can trust him, as far as he needs to, then goes over to talk to little Althea. He asks if she ever met her daddy. She says no, that her mama left him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Baby girl,” Chalky says, “you stay real close to your mama now, ya hear? Keep away from men like me.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Narcisse asks for Chalky’s gun, but he says not until after Daughter and Althea leave. Daughter insists they walk out together. “We’re headed to different places,” Chalky says. Then he kisses her on the cheek and watches as she walks away, Althea in her arms. “Our collaboration begins,” Narcisse says to Chalky.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Eli and Nucky are under the boardwalk, waiting for the “dirty little monkey.” He finally arrives, and Eli grabs him. Nucky empties out the kid’s sack. Out spills “Around the World in 72 Days,” by Nellie Bly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What’s your name?” Nucky asks the kid.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Nellie Bly,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky presses him and finally gets his answer: “Gillian.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in the present, Joe Harper is delivering some whiskey to the bar and sees a passed-out Nucky on the ground, conversing in his flashback with young Gillian, who was dressed like a boy. Nucky snaps out of it and offers Harper $50 to take him to the Rumpus. “You don’t have to pay me,” Harper says. “I already work for you.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in his office, Nucky asks the kid where he’s from and when he says Indiana, Nucky asks what he’s doing here. “Trying to get ahead.” Nucky insists he take the money.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Someone I was close to just died because of me,” Nucky explains. “Last thing I heard her say was ‘I have your coffee.’ She’s gone and I’m still here. What kind of world is that?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Archie walks in and tells Nucky to come downstairs. Mickey is giving a speech to a small, armed militia, getting them to swear an oath of allegiance to Nucky.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He looks up at Nucky and says: “Nobody knew where you were, so I did a Paul Revere. We settling up for a showdown or not?” Heartbeat. Thump-thump, thump-thump.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We are,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Daughter is gone, and Chalky opens a back door onto an alleyway. He asks Narcisse if he’s going to keep his word to Daughter.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Tell yourself I will,” Narcisse says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky tells him: “All a dream to begin with. Ain’t nobody ever been free.” Narcisse shoots him a dirty look and walks off. Five of his men pull their guns out. Chalky closes his eyes and imagines Daughter’s voice singing in his head.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Night breezes seem to whisper I love you.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He smiles. That frown finally melts away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For once, we don’t see the blood and the guts. All we hear are the gunshots ring out as the song abruptly stops and the sound of a record comes to its end, the needle stuck &#8212; going round and round and round as the credits roll.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>After a moment of silence for the departed, questions and talking points to ponder:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The bodyguard Arquimedes (a.k.a. Archie) is named after Archimedes, the Greek mathematician. Archimedes was killed by Roman soldiers. Will the same thing happen to Archie? Will Nucky start a gang war against the Italians?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Nucky says someone he loves has just died, is he talking about Mabel or Sally? Did Sally mention anything about coffee from Havana?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now that we have the Nellie Bly reference, we know Gillian is the one who wrote that mysterious letter to Nucky. Is she asking him to bust her out? And will he? He owes her big time, after all, having delivered her to the creepy Commodore.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What’s become of Eli’s son Willie? Are we done with his narrative arc now that he’s on the side of the good guys?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone mentions having been barbers. His father, Gabriele, was a barber from Southern Italy, though Al was born in Brooklyn on Navy Street near the Navy Yard, where many of the episodes are now filmed, at Steiner Studios. Coincidence, or strange synergy?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone (or a close facsimile) was played by Muni in “Scarface.” Until Mr. Graham came along, my favorite on screen Capone was Robert De Niro in “The Untouchables.” Wallace Beery played a version of Capone, as have Rod Steiger, Jason Robards, Al Pacino and George Raft. Who’s your favorite Capone?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of Francis X. Bushman’s last roles was in the “Batman” TV show in the 1960s, when he played a collector of silent films who is menaced by the Riddler. Is Korder a “Batman” fan?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is it just me, or was there very little emotional payoff when Van Alden and Chalky were killed? I mean, we’re certainly invested, having spent the past several years of our lives with these guys. The goodbye kiss to Daughter was touching and emotional. But maybe I’m just numb from all the blood and guts.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Episode 5: <a href="http://www.hbo.com/#/schedule/detail/Boardwalk+Empire+53:+King+of+Norway/600058">&#8216;King of Norway&#8217;</a> (Though Really, the Title Should Be &#8216;Surprise!&#8217;)</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We start the latest installment of HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Boardwalk Empire&#8221; with another flashback – except this one doesn&#8217;t go quite as far back as those earlier in the season. It’s Atlantic City, 1897, and a young deputy sheriff has been sent to check out a dead body under the old iron pier. It turns out the body’s not human, but porcine. When the complainant – Mrs. Zeller, an ornery old woman – asks who this deputy is, he says the name’s Enoch Thompson. No kidding. This actor (Marc Pickering) is a dead ringer for a young Steve Buscemi. (He also has Mr. Buscemi’s mannerisms as the adult Nucky Thompson down cold.)</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Capone (Stephen Graham) on the can, reading the paper. He’s constipated and agitated. Capone comes out and says he spoke to Nucky about Luciano&#8217;s plot against him, but all Nucky had to say was: “History doesn’t repeat itself. But it does rhyme.” (Which Nucky <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5382-history-doesn-t-repeat-itself-but-it-does-rhyme">stole from Mark Twain</a>.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone calls it “a message &#8212; like an omen.” He obviously has never read Twain. He knows he’s being investigated for income tax evasion – facing a minimum of five years in prison &#8212;  and announces that they have to move the entire operation out of Chicago, to nearby Cicero, by the next day. D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi), the undercover agent, looks slightly alarmed. Capone picks up on it and asks him what the problem is. “You got something better to do?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The nerdy accountant, Reese, meanwhile is upset that a big roach is crawling on his books. The bug is the least of their problems.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1931 A.C., the hobo kid that Mickey Doyle (Paul Sparks) picked to unload trucks one night comes into Nucky’s office all cleaned up. He’s Doyle’s assistant now, this Joe Harper, and he tells Nucky that Mickey needs to see him. (Isn’t it a little late in the show to be introducing completely new characters?) When Nucky pulls the door open, Chalky (Michael Kenneth Williams) is also sitting there, wearing a three-piece suit and that frown of his. Surprise! Chalky says he’s not packing: He had been frisked at the door.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky says, “That wouldn’t stop a man who’s made up his mind.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky offers him a drink, but Chalky declines. “Doesn’t anyone drink anymore?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When he asks Chalky what he’s been up to, he says he “ran with some boys” and then mumbles something about a gas station and getting left behind. “Done some time,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I heard you were still doing it,” Nucky shoots back.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky apologizes and says he doesn’t know where Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright) is. But he does know that Chalky’s family moved to St. Louis and is living under the wife’s maiden name. He offers Chalky a place to hide out and tells him he should start over.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We ain’t schoolboys no more,” Chalky says. (Ah, but in the flashbacks they were.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky peels off some money for him, and though Chalky at first refuses, Nucky insists: “This is between friends.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly, we’re inside one of Eli’s nightmares again, which includes a yodeling record and a portrait of a mustached man. Drunk again. There’s a knock at the door, which awakens Eli (Shea Whigham). It’s his wife, June (Nisi Sturgis), who’s been waiting at the station for Eli to show up. She’s visiting Chicago from A.C. and is &#8212; surprise! &#8212; seven months pregnant. It’s been that long since they’ve seen each other.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eli is shocked at, but thrilled with, her condition.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When she has the baby, Eli says, June should move to Chicago with the newborn and two youngest kids, because he needs her. “It’s a blessing, a chance to start over,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Not everyone gets that.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After a makeout session, Eli tells June they’ve been invited to his partner’s house for a home-cooked meal. Where other surprises await.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian (Gretchen Mol), meanwhile, is still passing her days at the insane asylum. Her crazy friend, Charlotte, runs in and urgently hands her a piece of paper and tells her, “Protect your fur.” Charlotte is dragged out by the matrons. The urgent piece of paper is an ad for Saks fur storage. Is this some kind of secret message – like Capone’s Twain message &#8212; or is Charlotte just crazy? I lay 10-to-1 odds on just plain crazy.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Next, Nucky is meeting with Johnny Torrio (Greg Antonacci) in Brooklyn about Luciano (Vincent Piazza) wanting to get him. Torrio says, “It don’t make sense.” Torrio seems slightly confused and preoccupied. He’s either losing his mind, too, or is up to something. I lay 10-to-1 odds on up to something. He again tells Nucky he should retire, then offers to meet with him and Maranzano (Giampiero Judica) to see what’s up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Nucky is meeting with his boss, Sheriff Lindsay (Boris McGiver). The sheriff tells Nucky he likes his girl, Mabel, but Nucky says Mabel’s father (Burke Moses) doesn’t like him. To win him over, Nucky is taking him to the fancy new Oyster House. (<a href="http://www.docksoysterhouse.com/">Dock’s Oyster House</a>, the real deal on Atlantic Avenue, actually opened in 1897 and is still in operation. The same family that opened Dock’s, the Doughertys, eventually bought <a href="http://www.knifeandforkinn.com/aboutus.php">the legendary Knife &amp; Fork</a> as well, which the real Commodore helped found.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky bumps into Pat Halligan (Danny McCarthy), the guy who lost his hat long ago, the one that Nucky retrieved and returned  at the Corner Hotel when he was a boy. Halligan has just left a meeting with the Commodore. “How’s the hat game these days?&#8221; Halligan asks. “Sailing right along, sir,” Nucky answers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The sheriff and Nucky go into their meeting with the Commodore (John Ellison Conlee) and Leander (a younger version of the <a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Leander_Cephas_Whitlock">Dominic Chianese&#8217;s character</a> with the crazy white facial hair.) (Remember, for the record, that Mr. Chianese, the actor, worked with Lansky in Havana in &#8220;The Godfather: Part II.&#8221; But that’s neither here nor there. Back to our story.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Halligan, they explain, is trying to renegotiate a longstanding agreement with the Commodore, putting on the “squeeze from New York.” The Commodore is angry and says he doesn’t want to see Halligan or his cronies around.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky suggests deputizing about 20 men and placing them at the train stations, ferries and hotels. “Anyone we don’t like the look of,&#8221; he says, &#8220;see them off.” (This was actually done by Mayor Frank Hague in Jersey City, where his zeps – or secret police – would patrol the streets and escort anyone they didn’t like out of the city.) There’s nothing illegal about it, Leander says, “Just enforcing the vagrancy laws.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At dinner at Van Alden’s house, Eli and June are trying to be polite, but the Van Alden clan seems unusually cranky, even for them. When young Chester tries to entertain the guests with his recorder, Van Alden (Michael Shannon) snaps, “Chester, that would sound better much further away.” Eli is telling Van Alden not to worry about Luciano&#8217;s having recognized him. “He can’t prove anything,” Eli says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Val Alden is worried and says that they’ll go after Eli, too, since he’s his partner. “You’ll fold,” he tells Eli.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When June compliments Van Alden on the house, his Norwegian wife, Sigrid (Christiane Seidel), complains about the leaky roof. June offers to have Eli come over and help Van Alden fix it. Sigrid seems especially agitated, and she insults her husband even more than usual, saying that one man – Eli – is enough for the job. She says that he should come over when her husband is not home (wink wink).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in New York City, it seems that Margaret (<a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Kelly_MacDonald">Kelly Macdonald</a>) has persuaded Carolyn Rothstein (Jennifer Ferrin) to take the deal she and Nucky have offered. At a meeting with the firm’s partners and her lawyer, Carolyn signs off and Margaret hands over the check – written out from Old Rumpus Associates. Carolyn&#8217;s lawyer puts up a fuss because of the company’s ridiculous name and its location out of state. “This is the deal,” Margaret says. “The only deal.” Carolyn snatches the check, folds it and sticks it in her wallet.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Afterward, Margaret’s big boss begins to chastise her for having been secretly married all this time and associating with criminals. But he’s really eager to thank Nucky personally. Margaret, cool as an oyster on ice at Dock’s, directs her boss to set up an account for Nucky under an assumed name, to be used for shorting the stock of the Mayflower Grain Corporation. Who’s bossing whom now? She’ll be running that firm in no time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Atlantic City, a United States marshal shows up at the Old Rumpus looking for Albert White, a.k.a. Chalky. He’s on the run, the marshal says, after killing a prison guard and the convict he escaped with. He asks Mickey if he’s seen him, a “colored fella” with a big scar on his face. There might even be a reward. Mickey leads him into the kitchen, where a black man in a suit is turned with his back to them. “Albert White,” the marshal says, drawing his gun, “Put down the knife and raise your hands.” When the man turns around, it’s not Chalky, but another African-American man with a big scar on his face. “Name’s Jenkins, sir.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s not him,” the marshal says. The marshal turns and leaves, then Chalky steps out from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Oh,” Mickey laughs. “There you are.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eli and June are helping clean up after dinner at Van Alden’s, and suddenly, Eli sees the picture of the man who was in his dream earlier. It’s a portrait of the king of Norway, hanging in the kitchen. Eli has his own flashback, (complete with a yodeling soundtrack), of having sex with Sigrid in this very kitchen.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You remember now,” Sigrid says. She calls everyone in the room a liar and announces that she and Eli have had sex (though she uses the premium cable verb, much to her young daughter’s horror and Van Alden’s surprise). June punches Eli in the stomach.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But that’s not the only after-dinner surprise, folks. D’Angelo shows up and flashes his badge. “Let’s take a ride,” he tells Van Alden. “You too, Sheriff Thompson.” Worst. Dinner. Party. Ever.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back at the insane asylum, one woman is cradling a shoe like a baby. Another is shivering on the floor. Still another shouts about butter and runs through the room. Gillian sits calmly, smoking a cigarette. She’s the odd girl out. Her friend, Charlotte, is wheeled in, looking subdued. Too subdued. Has she been given a lobotomy?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Dr. Cotton?” Gillian asks her. “What did he do to you?&#8221; She won’t answer. “Is it your mouth? Did he …” Gillian asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Charlotte opens her gown and reveals a giant, bloody incision across her abdomen. “The sickness,” she says, “was someplace else.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Young Nucky is having dinner at the Oyster House with his future father-in-law, explaining how he plans to make good right here in A.C. No need to go to Alaska for the gold rush. The city, Nucky explains, has doubled in size over a decade. There are 10,000 tourists every day in the summer. And he’s working his way up the ladder of success.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“From bellboy to deputy sheriff,” the father says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Every story has a beginning, sir,” Nucky says. And this is it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The father sends Mabel for some smokes and tells Nucky what he really thinks of him. “I don’t know what she sees in you,” he says. “I think you talk a bold line &#8230; but I don’t think you know what you are.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Well I suppose, sir,” Nucky answers, “that we’ll both find that out.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to the Cuban bodyguard (Paul Calderón), warily standing watch at the New York restaurant where Nucky is meeting with Maranzano. They’ve been waiting for Torrio but decide to go ahead with business. Nucky asks when he will get rid of Luciano.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“He disappoints me, that is true,” Maranzano says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“He’ll come for me again,” Nucky says, “and then he’ll come for you.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“When one sits on the throne, that is to be expected,” Maranzano explains.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A car pulls up with two machine-gun toting gangsters, who open fire, shattering the windows. The bodyguard covers Nucky and pushes him to the floor to safety, but it seems most everyone else is Swiss cheese. It’s not clear if Maranzano is dead or not. (In real life, Luciano had Maranzano shot and stabbed in 1931 inside Maranzano’s office in what is now the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue.  Morbid gangster fans like me can find actual photos of Maranzano’s dead body online.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback, Nucky knocks on the sheriff’s door late at night. “The jobs you do for the Commodore &#8212; that have their own rules &#8212; I can help with those,” he offers. The sheriff tells him to go home and that they’ll talk about it another time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian, in an obvious panic from seeing Charlotte’s nasty incision, is meeting with Dr. Cotton, the butcher, to calmly tell him personally that she has made a full recovery and is ready to talk about her release.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I took someone’s life in a state of temporary insanity out of grief,” she explains.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You know you were ill &#8212;  and now you know you’re not?” the doctor asks. “How? How do you know what you are?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“How do you know?” she shoots back. Crazy as a fox, that Gillian.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Where does insanity go?” he muses. Other illnesses re-emerge and are in the body forever unless they’re routed out.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We’ll find what’s inside you,” he promises. “We’ll fix it.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gillian needs a Plan B. Pronto.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In an interrogation room, Eli is asking Van Alden not to stare at him. “The event you’re thinking about?&#8221; Eli says. &#8220;It was an accident.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You mean like a streetcar hitting a horse? A man getting his head crushed in a metal press? A gas explosion in which bystanders are literally torn limb from limb? That’s what your having sexual relations with my wife was like?” Van Alden gets all the best lines these days.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I don’t know about you,” Eli says, “but my life is a&#8221; &#8212; insert another cable-ready adjective  &#8212; &#8220;shipwreck.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Well, land ho,” Van Alden says. Ha!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">D’Angelo and an associate walk in and run down their capital crimes, then tell them how they’re going to cooperate or get the gas chamber. D’Angelo gives them the key to Capone’s count room and the combination to the safe. They tell Eli and Van Alden to bring them the ledger books. Tonight is a good night, since there will be some Hollywood folks visiting Capone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Van Alden tells them those ledgers are written in code, D’Angelo shows him the solution. The accountant, Reese, he says, has agreed to cooperate.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“He’s screwy about bugs,” Eli says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">D’Angelo opens the closet door, where the accountant is bound and gagged, bugs crawling all over him. I hate gratuitous bug violence.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Torrio, Luciano and Lansky (Anatol Yusef) are meeting at Torrio’s house, telling him about the slaughter. “No telling who’s dead and who’s alive,” Lansky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Torrio asks who the shooters were. “Better you don’t know &#8212; keep out of it,” Luciano says. The phone rings. It’s Nucky, naturally.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We waited for you, John,” says Nucky, cuts all over his head from the window shattering.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I called,” Torrio says. “Didn’t you get the message?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Now I have a message for you,&#8221; Nucky says. &#8220;I will not rest until I see you in your graves.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Flashback to the old woman again complaining about another dead body under the pier. Except this time, Nucky finds a person. Halligan. And there’s a flashback within a flashback (a film noir staple!) of Halligan offering him the hat reward money when Nucky was a kid.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky is talking on the phone now to the Bacardi guy, Maxime Ronis (Lee Godart), in Cuba, who explains what happened to Sally (Patricia Arquette). “There was a dispute with the soldiers. She fired a gun. She died on the spot.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky wants names and says he’ll pay whatever it costs. (<a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/boardwalk-empire-recap-paying-the-price/">Cuánto!</a>) But Ronis says there are no names.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Harlem, Chalky shows up at Narcisse’s whorehouse. You knew he would. He pretends to be a john and is patted down because of the “ruckus a few nights back.” The doorman lets Chalky in. As he walks into the house alone, Chalky pulls a gun out of his pants. (I guess the guy didn’t do a very thorough pat down. And Chalky is a man who’s made up his mind.) He slowly turns a doorknob. Inside is a little girl, about 7 years old, just waking up on a couch.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The little girl’s mother steps into the room. It’s <a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Daughter_Maitland">Daughter Maitland</a> – surprise! &#8212; her face fully healed and as beautiful as ever. And this has <em>got</em> to be their daughter, with a small &#8220;d.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Season 5, Episode 4: &#8216;Cuánto&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s autumn on <a href="http://www.hbo.com/#/boardwalk-empire/episodes">HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Boardwalk Empire.&#8221;</a> And the reaper has arrived. The question is, whose door will he knock on this time? Because half the cast is based on historical figures, you can count out anyone who lived past 1931 in real life. So will it be Margaret? Mickey Doyle? Sally? Van Alden, a.k.a Mueller? Or how about that Cuban bodyguard?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We start out the episode with another Nucky (Steve Buscemi) flashback: As a young bellboy (Nolan Lyons), he is sweeping the last bits of sand off the Commodore’s porch, the summer season at an end. (Just as the show itself is coming to an end – only four episodes left!) He wanders into the empty lobby and is summoned by the Commodore (John Ellison Conlee).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky knocks on an office door. “Who’s knocking?” the Commodore shouts.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The bellboy.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Don’t walk into a room like a question mark!” he instructs young Nucky, the first of a series of taunts and lessons. The Commodore rolls a map of Atlantic City out onto his desk and tells his protégé of his plans: extending the boardwalk; paving Atlantic Avenue; running trains, ferries and trolleys; enforcing segregation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Commodore asks him why he’s not in school. Nucky says it’s because he works here. But the Commodore corrects him: “You worked here.” He tells him to return his uniform to the hotel manager.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly the flashback is over, and Nucky wakes up in his bed in 1931. Margaret’s brogue can be heard again in the next room, this time giving an English lesson to the Cuban bodyguard (Paul Calderón). Everything is so much more pleasant when Margaret (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/kelly-macdonald-glasgow-girl-made-good-9716993.html">Kelly Macdonald</a>) is around.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Nucky is cranky. He wants to know why no one awakened him for his flight to Havana. The flight has been canceled because of a storm. “I am please to meet you,” the bodyguard says to Nucky. (They&#8217;ve met before, of course, but the bodyguard has been the strong, silent type.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Margaret catches Nucky – and us – up on the reasons she’s here: Abe Redstone (a.k.a. Arnold Rothstein), the boss dipping into the account, the apartment, the boss’s suicide, the threats from Carolyn Rothstein (Jennifer Ferrin) threatening to “sue us both and drag your name through the papers.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to a newsreel: &#8220;Under the Reign of Public Enemy No. 1: Scarface Capone rules Chicago with iron fist!”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone (Stephen Graham) and his boys are hooting and hollering throughout the reel, which they’re watching in his <a href="http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id79.htm">Lexington Hotel headquarters</a>. Dead bodies attributed to Capone litter the screen, and with each one, a coked-up Capone yells “Bang!”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza), who has just arrived by train, is in the audience and tells Capone, “You’re the Italian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Beery">Wallace Beery</a>.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of the poor schlubs waiting on the gangsters laughs along with them, but Capone stops laughing and confronts him. “You think that’s funny?” (Visions of Joe Pesci from <a title="A clip, with profanity" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFW3kEbhZd4">&#8220;Goodfellas&#8221;</a> and Spider’s foot in a cast.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano rushes to the guy’s defense: “Lay off. He didn’t do nothing.” So Capone backs down.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano catches the eye of Van Alden (Michael Shannon) and immediately recognizes him, though he can’t place him. (Mr. Shannon’s giant, craggy face is not one of those you quickly forget. I remember recognizing him on my street in Brooklyn many years ago, from his turn as a mobster in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ocomEhLsE">&#8220;Kangaroo Jack.&#8221;</a>) Ages ago, Van Alden arrested Luciano. It’s only a matter of time before Luciano’s memory kicks in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another Nucky flashback, young Eli (Oakes Fegley) is burning ants on their front steps because he’s been locked out of the house. When Nucky climbs up and looks in the window, he sees his father having sex. Eli tries to climb up and get a look, but Nucky pulls him down. They start fighting and Nucky wins, then promises to buy Eli a cornball. (I thought cornballs were just uncool people, but I guess everything has its origin story.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With a flip back to the present, Nucky is on the phone with Sally (Patricia Arquette), to tell her he’s rained in by a storm. He’s supposed to deliver a payoff to Maxime Ronis (Lee Godart) of Bacardi, but now Sally will have to take care of it. There’s trouble in the provinces, the army is on the move, Sally says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While Nucky’s on the phone, Margaret has been yukking it up with Joe Kennedy (Matt Letscher) in the next room. He’s here to tell Nucky he’s not in on the booze deal. “Scotch and rum don’t really mix,” Kennedy says. But he’s charmed by Margaret.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Kennedy offers to take Margaret back to New York in his private train car. Two hours to Grand Central Station. Fresh oysters. Margaret considers it, but Nucky is not pleased.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“My husband would like me to stay,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Oh, you’re the missis?” Kennedy asks, turning to Nucky. “Well, that’s the first sensible thing I’ve heard him say.” He then exchanges some Gaelic pleasantries with Margaret and reminds Nucky there’s “safety in numbers” – a reference to a brood of kids.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sprinkled throughout the action of the narrative, Nucky flashes back again and again. At one point, he&#8217;s sitting on the beach with Eli, telling his young brother of the swells from New York and Philadelphia who live a life of leisure, with paintings and crystal glasses and carriages and fancy suits. “They don’t have to do anything,” he yells. “Can’t you see what we look like?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He grabs a hotel room key and takes Eli on a tour, showing him a toilet that flushes. Eli’s delighted. Nucky then takes a bath and is found out by the sheriff (Boris McGiver), who tells him to put his pants back on. Nucky asks Eli if he has any money.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“If you pay, he lets you go,” Nucky explains.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Why?” Eli asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Because that’s how it works,” his big brother tells him. Bribery and Extortion 101.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Instead of punishing the boys, the sheriff takes them home for dinner with his family. Nucky is so overcome by how well the family gets along that he starts to cry.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in the present, Nucky is at his favorite salumeria – the place he enjoyed the veal parmigiana with Kennedy – this time with Margaret. He asks if she took a cut of Rothstein’s portfolio. When she says no, he says, “You’ve got all the blame and none of the benefits.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Sorry to be such a disappointment,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky says he can’t just hand over a $111,000 payoff to Carolyn Rothstein – “What happens later, when she sees how easy it was?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You and I have a problem,” she says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“But only one of us has a solution,” Nucky answers. He pours her a glass of red wine and toasts to “partners in crime.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Chicago, Luciano gives Capone a souvenir from New York, a miniature Empire State Building. Anton Chekhov once mused that if the playwright presents a gun in the first act, it absolutely must go off by the end of the play.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In &#8220;Boardwalk Empire,&#8221; it doesn’t need to be a gun. Any pointy object presented into the narrative will wind up in someone’s neck or head by the end of the show. Are the writers (this episode was credited to the holy trinity of Howard Korder, Cristine Chambers and Terence Winter) running out of weapon ideas? Forget guns and knives. There’s been the hammer, the machete, the bottle, the meat cleaver, the bathtub. So when you see a pointy miniature Empire State Building, you just know someone’s going to get it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano tells Capone that change is coming, then presents the idea of an Italian syndicate that can run business throughout the country. Capone asks about Atlantic City, but his brother, Ralph (Domenick Lombardozzi), points out that Nucky is not Italian.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano tells Capone that he recognized Van Alden/Mueller as the fed who pinched him back in ’21 with Jimmy Darmody. The new undercover agent – Mike D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi) – is anxiously listening. Capone asks them to bring Mueller in to him. Cut to the miniature Empire State Building, now menacingly sitting on Capone’s desk.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Atlantic City, Nucky and Margaret are lingering at the Italian deli (their very own <a href="http://www.torrisinyc.com/">Torrisi Italian Specialties</a>). She has had a half-bottle of wine and is getting flirty. Nucky tells her he’s close to broke because of the Wall Street crash. But he says he’s proud of her for having shaken down Rothstein, holding down a job and raising the kids alone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’m still married,” she says. Flirt flirt.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Blame your church for that,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Haven’t been in three years.” Uh-oh.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Married, too, I suppose,” he says. They eventually shake hands. And he holds on, just for a moment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Chicago, Capone and his boys are interrogating Van Alden. Mueller. Whatever. He’s denying having been a fed or having worked in Atlantic City.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“On your knees,” Capone says. He takes out a gun. “I ain’t reaching up that high.” Van Alden kneels, and Capone places the gun in his mouth.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Come on,” a nervous D’Angelo says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“They got maid service,” Capone says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He asks Ralph to count to 30.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Van Alden starts blabbing as Ralph counts: “I worked for you for seven years. I broke heads in Cicero. I set up Dean O’<span class="st">Banion</span>. I make my number every week. Maybe I’m a federal agent. Maybe I’m a bigamist. Maybe I’m a murderer on the run.” He continues, hoping to turn the focus on Luciano: &#8220;That’s not what matters. What matters is this man comes in from out of town, starts telling Capone what to do about Capone’s business in Capone’s house.” In his opinion, he adds, that is pretty  “disrespectful.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now Luciano is starting to look nervous.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone pulls the gun away and instructs Luciano: “You can rule by fear or you can rule by love. Remember that if you’re ever in charge.” What a prince.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The gun is put away. But the Empire State Building is still off screen. I haven’t forgotten it. Will it wind up in Van Alden’s neck? In Luciano’s eye? (Oh wait. He can’t die yet, historically speaking.) Not this time around.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Van Alden and D’Angelo walk out of the room, D’Angelo says to him, “You’ve got a pair.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I need a men’s room,” he replies. “I may have soiled myself.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Cuba, Sally, sporting a fancy French manicure, is meeting with Maxime Ronis with a briefcase full of Nucky’s money. Suitcases are being prepared for a trip. “Goin’ somewhere?” she asks, in her Southern drawl. Ronis says his wife is headed to Paris. Sally says she has never been there, but she&#8217;s worried Ronis may leave himself, with Nucky’s cash.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She tells him about the political uprising in Gibara, where the military was sent in and 30 soldiers were killed. He says it’s far from Havana. But she reminds him it’s close to his sugar cane fields. The money, he says, is to pay off the soldiers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sally – who reminds me more and more of Mae West with each episode – asks to use the phone and calls Nucky in A.C. Mickey Doyle (Paul Sparks), who should have long ago been one of the dead bodies (remember Nucky’s insurance policy), answers the phone at the club, the Old Rumpus (formerly the Onyx Club), and flirts with Sally. Nucky is out with Margaret. So she instructs Mickey to tell Nucky the deed is done.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Margaret and Nucky are standing out on the boardwalk like old times, out in front of the club. “What is an old rumpus?” she asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“A fearsome beast with the paws of a lion, the belly of a Shriner and the expense account of a Westinghouse executive,” Nucky explains.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He reminisces about the time Margaret came over to his apartment after a temperance meeting all those years ago.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’d never seen anyone who looked so lost,” he says, then adds that he thought, “If I can save her, maybe I’m not so bad myself.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You did?” she says. She tells him that when she saw him living on the whole floor of a hotel, she figured he must be very lonely.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Maybe nothing changes,” he says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She puts her arms around his neck and lays one on him.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But soon it’s back to business. She asks if he’s going to kill Carolyn Rothstein. When he says no, she asks what the solution is.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“She’s going to take 25 cents on the dollar,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Your firm will stay afloat, and this whole thing gets buried.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“How are you going to manage that?” she asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You are,” he answers. “If you could put one over on Arnold, then you can do this.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When she says she has to get the train back to New York, he tells her to leave in the morning. But, she says, she doesn’t have a place to stay.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s a pause. Then he calls over a bodyguard and tells him to get her a room with an ocean view and a cab to the station first thing. Margaret looks slightly disappointed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We briefly cut to D’Angelo, who is searching furiously late at night through police files. And in no time, he finds a most-wanted file for Nelson Van Alden – for murder.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back to Capone. Luciano is saying his goodbyes, and as soon as he leaves, Capone spits at the door and starts mocking him. Everyone joins in. Even the schlub he scared earlier in the episode. The schlub calls Luciano a jerk (with a premium-cable-ready adjective).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What’d you call him?” Capone asks. “That’s a friend you’re talking about,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Since we’re babies, I know him.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It was a joke,” the schlub says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You like to make jokes.” Welcome back, Joe Pesci.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone starts laughing. “It’s too easy,” he says. It seems the danger has passed. Phew.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone goes to his office to make some calls. Everyone leaves. The schlub starts cleaning up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But out of nowhere – you knew it was coming – Capone hits him with the mini Empire State. He bashes his face in with the base and finishes him off with the point. Blood splatters all over the wall. Don’t worry: There’s maid service.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sally, meanwhile, is driving back from Miramar when she’s stopped on the road by a group of soldiers. She tells them she’s been visiting friends. They tell her there’s a curfew because of trouble across the country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“How much to go home?” she asks. Cuánto? (The episode’s title.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She’s told to get out of the car. The car is searched. The captain searches her, too, and finds a pistol strapped to her garter.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She says she runs a bar called Rubia Sucia (which translates as dirty blond) and invites them all to come up and see her sometime when the curfew ends.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When she tells the captain it’s Maxime she’s been visiting, he is not impressed. There are just some people who you can’t pay off. Maxime “pays a peso a day to cut cane until your hands bleed,” the captain explains. “You’re what’s wrong with Cuba.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sally starts back to the car. They apprehend her. She pulls one of their guns from a holster and, after a short stand-off, a soldier shoots her dead.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The captain reprimands the gunman for killing an American out in the open, then orders them to move her body off the road. So long, Sally. We hardly knew ya.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to the phone ringing in Nucky’s apartment. Capone, still covered in blood from the Empire State attack, has arranged for the call. There&#8217;s static on the line.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Sally, is that you?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Sorry to disappoint you. Call from Mr. Capone.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We got a problem,” Capone says. “His name’s Charlie.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Slow fade-out to the final flashback. The sheriff is driving Nucky and a sleeping Eli home in his horse and carriage.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Would you put my father in jail?” Nucky asks as they pull up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What for?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“He hurts my mother.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I could. Sooner or later, I’d have to let him go.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Maybe it wouldn’t be jail,” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What would it be?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The man in the hotel who asked for flowers. What you did with him.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“That was done for the Commodore, and that has its own rules. Understand? You don’t be foolish. Enough trouble in the world. Don’t go where you don’t belong.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He tells him to go inside, and he will tell his dad that he worked for him today. “Agreed?” They shake hands. And the sheriff says, “Deputy Sheriff Thompson.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Questions and talking points:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Nucky blame Sally’s death on Maxime and fly to Cuba for revenge? What will be his weapon of choice? A Cuban cigar? A mini Statue of Liberty? A cornball?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Carolyn Rothstein take the 25 percent and get going? Or will she wind up in a ditch somewhere in Jersey?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Margaret and Nucky have one last night of romance before the show ends? Or will she have an affair with Joe Kennedy back in New York?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Question for train buffs in the audience: Would a train to New York from New Jersey have stopped at Penn Station or Grand Central Station in 1931?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will D’Angelo team up with Van Alden to form a super fed undercover Dynamic Duo, or will he just bust him along with Capone when the time comes?</p>

<strong>Season 5, Episode 3: &#8216;What Jesus Said&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A hand breaks through a pane of glass on a door and turns the key on the other side. Chalky (<a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Kenneth_Williams">Michael Kenneth Williams</a>) and his new partner in crime, Buck, enter a neat, turn-of-the-century home. First things first, they raid the icebox. After their chain-gang escape and long journey, they’re hungry. Buck drinks from an old-fashioned milk bottle as Chalky cracks an egg into a glass and swallows it down. But they’re hungry for more than food.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You said a safe?” Chalky asks. “So where it at?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Somewhere,” Buck says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As they search the joint in the early morning light, a teenage girl in a white nightgown appears. They ask her for money, but she says, “We don’t have any cash.” She claims to be alone. Buck pulls out a gun and accuses her of lying.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She is; soon the girl’s mother, Marie, drifts downstairs as well.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Nucky’s 1880s flashback, a familiar setting in <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/boardwalk-empire-recap-lessons-to-last-a-lifetime/">this final season of HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Boardwalk Empire.&#8221;</a> Young Nucky seems to have been promoted from porch sweeper to all-around lobby boy at the Commodore’s Corner Hotel. Responding to the command “Boy!” over and over, Young Nucky (Nolan Lyons) scuttles around, setting up chairs on the beach, holding an umbrella over a woman in the rain, noticing a pretty young thing around his age on vacation and carrying flowers up to a man’s room. The man chats with him about love and asks him to bring fresh flowers every day. As if receiving an extra-special tip, Nucky gets a peek past the door at the man’s beautiful, naked companion inside.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Returning to 1931 Atlantic City, Nucky talks on the phone to Sally (Patricia Arquette) in Havana; she seems to be running a very nice-looking bar or maybe even a whole hotel. They discuss Senator Lloyd’s not showing up at the Mayflower Grain Corporation meeting, but Nucky tells her of a possible new partner for his enterprise, a Wall Streeter named Joe Kennedy, the “big fish coming down from Boston looking to get into the liquor business.” &#8220;Happy Days Are Here Again&#8221; comes on the radio, and Nucky and Sally listen to it together on opposite ends of the phone. “How’s that for an omen?” Nucky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He opens his mail as they listen. One letter has a return address: Miss Nellie Bly, The Pirate Sea, En route to Cathay. Nucky looks concerned. Is it from the real <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/world/peopleevents/pande01.html">Nellie Bly</a>, one of the first female muckraking journalists? (Seems unlikely, since she died in 1922.) Could it be the letter that Gillian (Gretchen Mol) was writing from the psychiatric ward? Is it his young, lost love from the flashback? Are she and Gillian one and the same? Hmmm.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In New York City, Margaret (Kelly Macdonald) is being questioned by some company men about Abe Redstone, the alias that Arnold Rothstein used at her investment company. They explain that although Rothstein died in 1928, his account was kept “very much alive” and that there had been 18 cash withdrawals over the years, amounting to $111,000. Margaret&#8217;s boss, Mr. Bennett (of the self-inflicted bullet to the brain), had been siphoning funds and using them to play the market. But Margaret was the signer of many of the checks. She explains that she often signed off on much of Mr. Bennett’s business. The widowed Mrs. Rothstein is about to sue the firm, and they’re looking for someone to take the fall.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back to the home invasion, which borrows heavily from Truman Capote’s <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/i/in-cold-blood/book-summary">&#8220;In Cold Blood.&#8221;</a> (The episode&#8217;s co-authors, Cristine Chambers and Howard Korder, must be fans.) Readers of that nonfiction classic will recall that Dick and Perry break into the Clutter home because Dick heard from a cellmate who had once done work on the Clutter family farm that there was a safe there. Buck (whose name is close to Dick) says that he once delivered ice to a fancy party here years ago and that the man of the house just watched him haul the 100-pound block. All he gave Buck was a “that’ll do.” Buck seems to still hold a grudge.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He says he saw a safe in the basement. The women, Fern and her mother, Marie, claim not to have it any more but offer $9 from Marie’s purse. “Take it and go,” Marie says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fern tells them that her father is away on business. Buck menacingly aims a gun at them, while Chalky tries to defuse the situation by asking her what grade she’s in. Tenth, she answers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky knows, from having children, that if the girl doesn’t go to school today, someone might send a truant officer around. The mother agrees. “Yes, they’ve very vigilant,” she says. Chalky is itching to leave.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Get the green, and let’s get ourselves gone in daylight,” Chalky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Buck is not backing down. “There’s a safe in that cellar,” he says. “I done seen it with my own eyes. I never forget it.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fern and Marie claim to no longer have the safe, having moved everything to a safe deposit box in the bank. They offer to go to the bank to get the valuables. “I’ll stay, and Fern can go into town,” Marie says, nervously.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky suggests they forget it and just tie the women up and leave. The father will find them when he returns home, and he and Buck will be long gone. But Buck refuses to give up.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In Harlem, Chalky’s old nemesis, Dr. Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright), is meeting with Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza) and Bugsy Siegel (Michael Zegen). Maranzano wants to continue the drug business that Masseria conducted with Narcisse. But that’s not all: Maranzano wants to offer Narcisse protection.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Against what?” Narcisse asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Luciano explains: “People are losing things all over. Some guy, he’s a millionaire, next thing you know he’s selling Chiclets in the street.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Or worse,” Bugsy says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Narcisse is not easily rattled. “I thank you both for your concern,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and I’m sorry you came up this far for nothing.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Atlantic City, Kennedy (Matt Letscher) is visiting Nucky and brags that he has eight children. Nucky claims to have two and mentions that his nephew is an assistant in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. (So Willie got the job after all.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Over veal parmigiana and an offer of red wine, Nucky discovers that Kennedy doesn’t drink. “It’s hard enough doing business as an Irish Catholic,” Kennedy explains. “I try my best to thwart the notion that we’re all drunkards.” So Nucky changes his own order to seltzer.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Buck, meanwhile, falls asleep in a rocking chair with the gun in his hand. Marie and Fern, still in their nightgowns, are tied up with rope, just like the Clutters from Capote’s book. And I’m hoping, nervously, that they won’t meet the same fate. Marie tries to persuade Chalky to take the gun and leave, but Chalky tells her to shut her mouth.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fern asks Chalky about his own daughter. He says he called her Maybelle. He doesn’t mention that Maybelle was accidentally shot and killed at the end of last season while in his Onyx Club. So anything is possible. Innocent young women get murdered all the time on &#8220;Boardwalk Empire.&#8221; I’m on the edge of my seat, worried there will soon be “hair all over them walls” – to quote Dick.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There’s forgiveness for everyone,” Fern says. “That’s what Jesus said.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Baby girl,” Chalky answers, “Jesus was wrong.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There’s a knock at the door, and a package is left on the doorstep. It’s a dress for Fern’s spring formal. Buck, now awake, unties Fern and tells her to put it on. She starts to put it on over her nightgown, but he demands, “Put it on proper.” As she starts to slowly take off her nightgown, Chalky makes a move to stop what’s unfolding, (just like Perry did to Dick when he proposed raping the young Nancy Clutter), but not before Marie blurts out, “The safe is upstairs!”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Margaret, back in New York, sits down to tea with Mrs. Rothstein, who serves it black. “I don’t keep milk in the house any more,” Carolyn Rothstein (Jennifer Ferrin) says. “It turns my stomach.” (You’ll recall A.R. loved his milk and cake.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Carolyn, one tough cookie, gets right down to business and lets Margaret know that she knows all about her. Not just that she was living in a Rothstein apartment but that her husband is Nucky Thompson. “Nineteen years of marriage &#8212; do you know what I have to show for it?” Carolyn asks. “This tea set, that hideous chair, this ring and humiliation. Arnold left me buckets of that.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She wants the money that was taken from the account. When Margaret says she doesn’t have that kind of money, Carolyn shoots back, “Your husband does.” Carolyn’s ring, she explains, came from a treasure chest at the Egyptian-themed party hosted by Margaret and Nucky years ago, a party Rothstein attended. The chest was hauled out, and all the guests got to choose from a lavish display of jewelry. Ah, the good old days. If Margaret doesn’t pay up, she may have something in common with Carolyn: seeing her name in the paper next to the phrase “notorious husband.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In other flashbacks, Nucky is bringing flowers to the man in the room with the naked woman again, but no one answers. The Commodore (John Ellison Conlee) sends him off to drive a pony cart for some vacationers. Nucky is parked with the pony as a couple sleep on the beach. Their daughter, the young girl he spied earlier in the episode, comes over the dunes after taking a pee and recites some lines from the Bible having to do with Enoch – who walked with God and was taken up to heaven without dying. They discuss the passage. She then offers Nucky 10 cents to kiss the pony. So much for scholarly Biblical debate.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When her mother calls, she quickly turns away. But when she looks back, Nucky walks over to the pony and plants one on his snout. He then sees the man who asked for the flowers standing on the beach, alone. Nucky explains that he had brought the flowers again, but no one answered. “Be sure she gets them,” the man says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chalky, meanwhile, is hammering away at the upstairs safe, to no avail. He and Buck are arguing over the fact that they can’t open it. When Marie says her husband has the combination, Buck breaks the wall to pieces with the hammer. Since anything can really happen in this show, and since – spoiler alert to anyone who’s never read &#8220;In Cold Blood&#8221; &#8212; the Clutters were massacred by Dick and Perry, I expect Buck to bash their heads in as well. Instead, even worse, he grabs the gun and holds it to Fern’s head, at which point Marie yells out, “I’ll open it!” (This woman has got to be kidding. I would have opened that safe hours ago.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Inside are liberty bonds, the only thing the father – who was never really coming home &#8212; left them. Buck cocks the gun, but Chalky hits him in the head with the hammer. When that doesn’t do the trick, and Buck attempts to choke Fern, Chalky plants the sharp end of the hammer in his neck. (Those writers, always looking for new ways to kill people!) So much for new friends.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That feisty Fern grabs the gun and points it at Chalky and asks if his own daughter knows what he is. “She knew what I was,” Chalky says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Take the $9 and get out of our house,” Marie orders.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in the present, Nucky is entertaining Kennedy in his burlesque club, trying to persuade him to join him in the bootlegging trade. In the upstairs office overlooking the club (a staple in many film noir movies), Kennedy is talking about his kids, how he’s teaching them to sail. He calls Nucky out on the fact that there are no photos or drawings anywhere from his own children. “What’s that got to do with making money?” Nucky asks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s what you’re making it for,” Kennedy answers. A tense conversation ensues, in which Nucky admits, “I want to leave something behind.” Kennedy pours him a drink and then goes off to meet with one of the burlesque dancers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky, oh so lonely, downs it and then pours himself another.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While Mickey Doyle rounds up some hobos to help load Nucky’s liquor trucks, Bugsy and another friend are paying a visit to Harlem to one of Narcisse’s whorehouses. (It seems Narcisse has branched out into other enterprises over the past seven years.) They execute the pimp and kill all the prostitutes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a flashback, Nucky returns to the man’s room to deliver the flowers, but the sheriff answers the door. The naked woman lies dead behind him, her throat slashed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky tells the sheriff (Boris McGiver) that he saw the man in the room. “On the beach south of town.” To which the sheriff replies, “It’s taken care of.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You caught him?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I did what’s right.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“He said he loved her,” Nucky says, obviously confused.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The sheriff tells him to keep the whole episode “just between us.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky opens an envelope left for him by one of the guests. (Which echoes the earlier letter he got from “Nellie Bly.”) On the postcard is a boy and a girl and a pony cart. And the other side reads: “We are here for a few weeks every summer. Mabel Jeffries. PS I would have let you kiss me.” Serious &#8220;Boardwalk&#8221; aficionados know that Mabel was Nucky’s first wife, who died in 1913. (<a href="http://www.atlanticcityexperience.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:enoch-nucky-johnson&amp;catid=6:biographies&amp;Itemid=11">Nucky Johnson</a>, the real Atlantic City boss whom the series is based on, was married to a woman named Mabel Jeffries, who died of tuberculosis.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky is dreaming of this moment in the present after having fallen asleep on the sofa. He hears a noise and sees a woman sitting in the dark on the other side of the room. “Mabel?” he asks, still half asleep.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’m afraid not,” Margaret says in that familiar brogue. She turns on the light.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And Nucky smiles.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Cold-blooded questions and talking points:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Dr. Narcisse start a war with Maranzano now that his prostitutes have been slaughtered? Or will be simply pay the protection money?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Nucky and Margaret get back together and live happily ever after? Or will he write her a check for $111,000?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now that Chalky has $9, where will he go? Will he try to visit his old buddy, Narcisse?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is that letter to Nucky from Gillian, Mabel, the ghost of Nellie Bly or some other secret admirer?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Kennedy and Nucky go into business together? Maybe Kennedy, Rose, Nucky and Margaret will go on a double date now that Margaret’s back. But will they drink Coca-Cola or moonshine? Will they get the families together? Maybe a young J.F.K. will make a cameo.</p>

<strong>Season 5, Episode 2: &#8216;The Good Listener&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It starts inside an ear, à la David Lynch. The bad dream pulls us in: A Victrola playing the voice of Eddie Cantor (Stephen DeRosa), as fish fry in a pan, a woman moans and booze is poured. Eli Thompson (Shea Whigham) gets up off the floor, the camera zooming out of his ear – and from inside his head. He looks hung over &#8212; unshaven, his suit rumpled, his hair matted. The dream and the party are over. Not only for him, but also for the rest of the country. The 1920s are done, and once again, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/531675/Terence-Winter">Terence Winter</a>, who wrote this episode, reminds us that the Depression – and with it, depression – has arrived.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The real nightmare (like the one in Mr. Lynch’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWr4JvAWF20">&#8220;Blue Velvet&#8221;</a>) is about to begin.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For seven years, since killing a federal agent, Eli has been separated from his family. He’s gone underground in Chicago, working for Al Capone’s boys. And he misses his family something awful.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unlike in past seasons, no one seems to be having much fun these days on <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire#/">&#8220;Boardwalk Empire.&#8221;</a> Well, maybe Capone (Stephen Graham), who seems to have some new scars on his face and also seems to have lost his mind, laughing at everyone and everything. But with a new character showing up, Eliot Ness (Jim True-Frost), he won’t be laughing for long.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Eli gets up from the floor in an upstairs warehouse room, he hears shouting and whistles blowing from down below. Ness’s raid of Capone’s liquor is underway, and so Eli flees.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky (Steve Buscemi), meanwhile, meets with Johnny Torrio (Greg Antonacci) in New York, where Torrio has retired after surviving an attempted hit on him by Capone back in Chicago last season. Torrio urges Nucky to retire as well, but Nucky won’t be satisfied until he closes this last deal in Havana, to import Bacardi once Prohibition is lifted. Nucky asks Torrio if it was the new boss Salvatore Maranzano (Giampiero Judica) who put the hit out on him in Havana. Torrio doesn’t know but offers to broker a meeting, so Nucky can look Maranzano – the Boss of Bosses – in the eye and ask him if he ordered the hit.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The flashbacks to 1884 Atlantic City continue from last week, but they no longer have that Terrence Malicky golden glow to them. The young Nucky has started working for the Commodore, and his innocence is lost. Nucky’s sister, Susan (Onata Aprile), has died. He and his brother, Eli, peek into the bedroom at the corpse as his mother and his father, Ethan, pray and swat away flies. Eli breaks down crying. (This is echoed later in the episode as he sits years later in his room in Chicago, listening to a family radio program and sobbing because he misses his own family.) They’re all waiting for the undertaker, but he won’t be coming: Ethan has spent the money for the funeral on booze. This is the unhappy, nightmarish side of America’s romance with alcohol, which led many women’s temperance groups to push for Prohibition. It’s not all parties and good times, but people drowning their sorrows and tearing their families apart.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The thought of her in potter’s field,” cries Nucky’s mother (Erin Dilly, who was the one in the voice-over last episode. Thanks to the reader John B. for pointing that out.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“She’ll rest in the yard, so she’s closer,” Ethan says.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in New York, a half-century later, Willie, Eli’s son, arrives for a job interview. He’s fresh out of law school and sits down in front of Robert Hodge, a United States attorney who seems to have no idea about Willie’s background and who immediately starts into a hypothetical question to test the young lawyer&#8217;s ethics. He doesn’t know that Willie (Ben Rosenfield) poisoned one of his schoolmates at Temple University and got off because of his Uncle Nucky’s connections. Willie seems to have forgotten all about it. Asked if he would – hypothetically – conveniently lose some files so that the police could hold a suspect a few extra days, Willie claims he would not.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The law’s a shield, sir,” he says. “Not a sword.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Hodge learns who Willie is and asks him about Nucky, Willie responds, “You don’t get to choose your relatives, sir.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To which Hodge replies, “No, but some of us get to choose our staff members.” Interview over.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Willie gets up to leave, he explains why he wants to be an assistant United States attorney. To prosecute criminals, he says, “the ones who divide families.” Then he adds: “I know the way crime eats you out from the inside. I know it and I hate it. Give me a chance, sir.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Capone, or should we call him Scarface? He&#8217;s getting his measurements taken for some new suit pants, surrounded by his cronies and the press, a swell buffet spread out before them all. It seems the past seven years have been good to Capone. He’s the famous mobster he wanted to be. No one spells his name wrong in the paper, the way they once did.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Capone is waiting for his new right-hand man, Mike D’Angelo (Louis Cancelmi), to show up for a meeting. When he arrives, he tells Capone about Ness’s raid and reports that 600 cases of Canadian Club and just under $20,000 have been confiscated. Capone wants the cash back, natch. So D’Angelo – who is also a federal agent – tells Eli and Van Alden (now Eli’s boss in Chicago) to recover the dough.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Riding in the elevator of Capone’s building (while the elevator operator whistles the Depression standard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqsT4xnKZPg">&#8220;Happy Days Are Here Again&#8221;</a>) Eli and Van Alden (Michael Shannon) spy Capone’s man Jake Guzik, a.k.a. Greasy Thumb (Joe Caniano) with a satchel of money. Jake was the overweight guy who got beaten up a couple seasons back for smelling so bad. In a nod to the past episode, Van Alden tells the rumpled Eli that he reeks of urine.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perhaps the only person having a worse time of it than the forlorn Eli is Gillian (Gretchen Mol), who was arrested at the close of last season for the murder of young Roger (the Jimmy Darmody lookalike she drowned in a bathtub to pass off as Jimmy’s corpse so she could inherit the house). At first it seems as if Gillian is relaxing in a spa with other women, her bobbed red head sticking out from the top of a bathtub. (Ah, another bathtub.) When the “spa attendant” turns off the radio playing in the background, Gillian’s companion freaks out and jumps out of her tub, followed by the other women in the “spa.” It turns out it’s a psychiatric hospital, and it seems Gillian is the only sane one in the room.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To restore order to this nightmarish scene, a frightening matron with a Marcel wave and a club in her hand enters the room and asks them all if they’re being good. Gillian says she has been a good girl and asks, “May I have what I asked for?” To which the scary matron replies, “If I get what I ask for.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yikes. (My mind flashed to the awful female camp commandant in Lina Wertmüller’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsZ5MsgdlSw">&#8220;Seven Beauties.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a much nicer setting, Nucky is meeting with the members of the Mayflower Grain Corporation to try to work out a partnership for his post-Prohibition dreams. Jackhammers and pounding can be heard outside the Manhattan window. Rockefeller Center, that monument to 1930s New York, is being built nearby.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Nucky is rebuffed, since his patron, Senator Lloyd (the one he set up with a prostitute in Havana), has failed to show up. Downstairs, after the meeting, one of the men from the boardroom sympathizes with Nucky and says he’s got deals like the Bacardi plan in place with Dewar&#8217;s and Moët. They shake hands and the man, with a strong New England accent, introduces himself as Mr. Kennedy (Matt Letscher).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In another flashback to Nucky&#8217;s childhood, the sheriff of Atlantic City (Boris McGiver, who will be familiar to viewers of &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; and &#8220;The Wire&#8221;) urges the Commodore to send something over to Nucky’s family in its time of grief, but the Commodore replies, “The kid’s old man thinks I’m the devil.” The Commodore goes anyway and offers Ethan some cash.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“You think you can buy me twice?” Ethan asks, revealing their previously unexplored bad history.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“No one forced you to sell that land,” the Commodore replies. When Ethan returns with a shotgun, the Commodore puts the money down and drives away. Ethan takes the money and goes off, presumably for a much needed drink. Susan is later buried in the yard. Nucky is left to fill in the grave.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Later, in 1931 Chicago, Eli and Van Alden steal the bag of money from Jake and his two Capone associates. Jake drops the bag and sheepishly runs inside, but the other two are shot in the head. Eli and Van Alden then deliver the cash to Capone, to square up for the Ness bust.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky, meanwhile, meets with Maranzano, who claims to have nothing to do with the attempt on his life. Tonino Sandrelli, the old right-hand man of <a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Gyp_Rosetti">Gyp Rosetti</a>, serves them coffee. Tonino is the one who stabbed Rosetti in the back (literally, folks) at the end of Season 3 and was one of the hit men who killed Joe Masseria in last week’s show. (The other was Bugsy Siegel, played by Michael Zegen.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky later confides to his Cuban bodyguard (Paul Calderón) that he wants out of the business, that the “trick is to stay alive long enough to cash out.” But it’s not clear if the bodyguard even knows what he’s saying. He’s the Good Listener of the episode title.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky has the bodyguard invite Tonino to dinner to ask him who ordered the hit. Tonino nervously tells Nucky it was Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza) and Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef), just as Nucky suspected. Tonino tells him he’s worried they’re going to stab him in the back as well. Nucky offers Tonino a job. But after Nucky gets up to leave, the waiter calls attention to the caricature above Tonino’s table. It is Billie Kent, the love of Nucky’s life, whom Rosetti – and Tonino – killed in the big explosion at <a href="http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Babette%27s_Supper_Club">Babette’s</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Uh-oh.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Cut to Gillian in the attic of the psychiatric hospital with the scary matron, who is undressing. “Are you sure we should be doing this?” Gillian asks, then reaches down to an old trunk and pulls out a floral dress, one she wore on New Year’s Eve back in the good old days. The matron simply wants the beautiful dress – in exchange for giving Gillian some paper and a pen. Phew.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At Lansky’s swank New York clubhouse, screams arise from downstairs. When Lansky runs out to see what the fuss is about, Tonino is lying on the vestibule stairs with his throat slit and a postcard – Greetings From Havana – stuck in his back with a knife. His ear is cut off (compliments of Nucky’s body guard, who seems to be amassing a collection). And just as the episode began, inside an ear, it ends with us falling down into the bloody ear canal of Tonino. I wonder if David Lynch is watching, or at least listening.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Some questions and points to ponder for all you good listeners:<br />
</strong><br />
Is Capone&#8217;s right-hand man, D’Angelo, two-timing Capone or the feds? And how long before Ness or Capone figures it out?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will young Willie get the job with the United States attorney? And if he does, will he have to get all his Uncle Nucky’s friends and relatives out of prison?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Whom is Gillian writing to? And how much luggage was she able to bring with her to the booby hatch, as the matron calls it?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Lansky make another move on Nucky or move to Havana full time? Is he the one having the affair with Sally Wheet?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And most important, what is the bodyguard doing with those ears?</p>

<strong>Season 5, Episode 1: ‘Golden Days for Boys and Girls’</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the premiere of the fifth and final season of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire#/">“Boardwalk Empire,”</a> we skip ahead seven years, to 1931, and the depths of the Great Depression. Unemployment hovers at a whopping 16 percent. Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) is in Cuba, working out a deal with Bacardi to provide soon-to-be-legal rum to “the thirstiest country on earth.”</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A lot has transpired in the past seven years. Sally Wheet — played by Patricia Arquette (fresh off the screen from <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/patricia-arquette-on-why-she-needed-to-make-boyhood-and-why-it-was-so-weird-to-finally-watch-it-20140714">her turn in “Boyhood”</a>) — has settled in Havana. Chalky is on a chain gang, though we don’t know what for. Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef) has gotten hitched, or so it seems at first. And a new boss is about to take out an old boss, Joe Masseria (Ivo Nandi). We witness a machete killing (the second in the series, by my count), a severed ear, a pickaxe to the chest, a bloody-dagger Mafia initiation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But eclipsing all that change and gore is a glowing, golden flashback – à la &#8220;The Godfather, Part II&#8221; – which takes us back to 1884, to Nucky’s origin story. Between scenes of the dirty, violent here and now, Nucky remembers his past.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Call it boyhood, the Atlantic City version.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The show’s creator, Terence Winter, and the episode’s writer, Howard Korder (whose first big success was the 1988 play <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/01/theater/stage-korder-s-boys-life.html">“Boys’ Life”</a>), don’t have the luxury of actual time passing that the director of “Boyhood,” Richard Linklater, had. But they do have a fictional version of a young Nucky, the well-cast, sweet, but intense Nolan Lyons. In a nod to another very talented Terence, the episode begins with a Terrence Malick-like shot from under the ocean, lithe bodies of boys diving and swimming after gold coins that are being tossed at their heads. There’s a voice-over of a woman – Gretchen Mol, is that you? – reading from a children’s poem: <em>&#8220;Be honest and true, boys!/Whatever you do, boys,/Let this be your motto through life.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The coins are being thrown by – who else? – a top-hatted Commodore (played by a younger Dabney Coleman lookalike, John Ellison Conlee). Nucky is too slow to catch any gold, though.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But that will soon change. The Commodore runs his Corner Hotel on the boardwalk, and soon Nucky – one of the struggling “pier boys” — will be working for him. Which we already know. What we don’t know, yet, is how that comes about. And we keep getting interrupted.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The golden light that suffuses the A.C. flashbacks and the Cuba scenes gives way to a depressing gray palette whenever we follow Chalky’s story. His new nickname is Stripy – for the prison uniform he wears. “Got myself caught,” is Chalky’s only explanation of what landed him here. He has a short gray beard, which can’t hide the actor Michael Kenneth Williams’s signature frown. Just as we’re getting used to Chalky’s new nickname, a fight erupts between the prisoners and the guards. There’s the pickaxe to the chest. Shovels hit heads. And Chalky manages to shoot off the face of one of the guards – the jerk that keeps calling him Stripy. So much for the new nickname. Chalky and one of his prison pals high-tail it into the woods. The friend pulls a gun on Chalky and asks him some garbled questions about how telephones work. I have no idea what they’re talking about. Information, please.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In New York City, Margaret (Kelly Macdonald), whose hair has grown since last season, sports a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/explore/marcel-waves/">Marcel wave</a> and is still working for the same stockbroker crooks who, this being the Depression, are about to get their comeuppance. She listens as her boss, Mr. Bennett, gives her and all her co-workers a pep talk. But midspeech, Bennett pulls out a pistol and blows his brains out. Margaret is later called into the office of the big boss, who wants the key to Bennett’s filing cabinet. She claims not to have it. But that sly Margaret is soon flipping through the files, searching for the folder for Arnold Rothstein (alias, A. Redstone).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Back in Cuba, Nucky is no longer the boy who’s too slow to catch the gold coins thrown at his head. Between conga lines and drinking El Presidente cocktails, which made me very, very thirsty (The Times has <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12516-el-presidente">a recipe</a>), he’s working on Senator Wendell Lloyd, pushing him to annul the Volstead Act. “I want everything set up and ready the day the vote comes down,” Nucky says, “so I can be there first.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a series of further nods to &#8220;The Godfather, Part II,” Nucky sets the senator up with a prostitute, and then afterward he tosses that arrangement in his face, implying he will expose the senator if he doesn’t play ball. A street protest erupts, reminiscent of the rebels Michael Corleone witnessed on a Havana street. And on that same street, Nucky bumps into Meyer Lansky. (An older, ailing Lansky walked the streets of Havana in Francis Ford Coppola’s film, as I’m sure you recall.) This time around, the young Lansky claims to be on vacation with his wife. He says that the last time he saw Nucky was at &#8220;A.R.&#8217;s funeral.&#8221; (In real life, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Rothstein.html">Rothstein died in 1928</a>.) Lansky also claims not to be in touch anymore with his best bud, Charlie Luciano.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky is soon attacked by a machete-wielding killer – hit man or a disgruntled sugar worker? We may never know. Luckily, Nucky’s brave and handsome Cuban bodyguard disarms the man, firmly planting the machete in his head and slicing off the man’s ear as a souvenir.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Later, Nucky bumps into Meyer’s “wife” and discovers that she is a Cuban prostitute. Could it have been Meyer who set up the hit? Definitely a possibility.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Because meanwhile, back in New York City, Luciano is sitting down with Joe Masseria, just finishing off his fifth cup of espresso. He goes to use “the head” – in yet another &#8220;Godfather&#8221; nod. We expect him to come out of the john, pistol blazing, Pacino-style. But in a slight twist, we see two hit men enter the restaurant, and as Luciano runs the water in the sink, shots ring out. When Luciano exits the bathroom, Masseria is floating in a spreading pool of blood.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a reward for his double cross, Luciano is made capo to the new boss, Salvatore Maranzano, in a ritualized Mafia ceremony in which Luciano slices his right hand with a dagger and then shakes the hand of each man in the room, after each, in turn, slashes his own hand. “To us,” they say, over and over, in Italian.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But back to the real story. Nucky’s boyhood. Throughout the past four seasons, references have been made to the tough childhood he and Eli survived. Their wonderful, sweet mother. Their no-good, abusive father. A dead sibling or two. And now we meet them. In all their golden-age glory.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nucky’s sister, Susan, is sick and dying in a back room. Pop, a bay fisherman, already grief-stricken, smacks Nucky in the head at the dinner table. When Pop isn’t watching, Nucky’s goodhearted mother secretly gives him a magazine – Golden Days for Boys and Girls – (also the episode’s title). Inside is the poem we hear recited throughout.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To try to make a few pennies, Nucky and his friends hide in the Malicky reeds and wait for the passing motorcars to go by. When the wind hits just right, the gentlemen’s hats fly into the reeds and the boys fetch them for a small reward. But Nucky is too slow. Once again.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of the Commodore’s men steps from the motorcar, still hatless, and asks where his could be. Nucky later finds it in the reeds, and inside the inner flap is tucked a $50 bill. He takes it home and mulls it over for a while. Should he succumb to instant gratification, like those kids in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment">the famous marshmallow experiment</a>, and walk away with the easy reward? Or should he be patient and parlay it into a bigger score? He decides to return it, not so much out of honesty but out of hopes of catching bigger fish with it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the Corner Hotel (based on <a href="http://www.atlanticcityexperience.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:louis-qcommodoreq-kuehnle&amp;catid=6:biographies&amp;Itemid=11">the actual Commodore’s A.C. hotel</a>, though it was not on the actual boardwalk), Nucky returns hat in hand. With the $50 bill inside. The Commodore asks why he didn’t just keep it. “Answer true,” he says, echoing the poem.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“To get myself ahead,” says Nucky. The Commodore offers him his first job, sweeping sand from his porch.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And so ends a boyhood, honest and true.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Some questions and talking points for us boys and girls to ponder:</strong></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is Margaret still living in Rothstein’s rent-free building? That lease should have been up two years ago. So what’s she up to? Will she buy low? Sell high?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Will Chalky get a job working for the telephone company with his new friend? And what exactly did he do to land himself on that chain gang? More important, will he shave the beard?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Nucky asks Sally to come up to his room, she says she’s not alone, then walks off arm in arm with the ear-toting bodyguard. Are they an item? Is she going upstairs to see his ear collection? Or is he just watching out so she doesn’t get hit with a machete, too?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is Lansky married to a Cuban prostitute, or is he plotting Nucky’s murder so the gang back in New York can take over the rum business in Cuba? Remember your “Godfather” history, children, with the old Lansky talking about his days running rum from those parts.</p>
