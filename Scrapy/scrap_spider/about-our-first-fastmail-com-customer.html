<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2014/10/28/about-our-first-fastmail-com-customer/'>About our first fastmail.com customer</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 27 October 2014</p>
<p>Since we <a href="http://blog.fastmail.com/2014/10/23/fastmail-has-moved-to-fastmail-com-fastmail-com-email-addresses-now-available/">rolled out our new fastmail.com domain last
week</a>,
we’ve had 10,000’s of users use the domain to rename, signup and create
aliases.</p>

<p>We decided to have a quick look through our logs and find the first
customer to use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">fastmail.com</a> and ask them a
few questions about themselves and FastMail. Thanks for taking some time
out to answer questions for us Joe D!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What country &amp; city do you live in?</strong></p>

<p>Newcastle, Australia</p>

<p><strong>What do you do for a living?</strong></p>

<p>I'm a software developer at a services company for the mining and energy
industries in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you used FastMail?</strong></p>

<p>I signed up to FastMail when I was in high school, back in 2002. I've
been pretty happy since then. My home address changes more often than my
email address.</p>

<p><strong>How did you find out about FastMail?</strong></p>

<p>It was so long ago, I honestly don't remember!</p>

<p><strong>Why do you use FastMail?</strong></p>

<p>I love FastMail for the power-user features. I like being able to set up
Personalities to send from different email addresses, and being able to
control every aspect of my email filtering through Sieve scripts. Plus I
seem to get way less spam than at addresses I've tried at other
providers.</p>

<p><strong>What domain was your previous FastMail address at?</strong></p>

<p>I have a few addresses on the mailbolt.com domain, which I'll continue
to use for certain things like store memberships, news subscriptions,
banking and bills. I also have a "junk" address on this domain, since
every website and his dog requires you to sign up and provide an email
address these days.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you want a fastmail.com address?</strong></p>

<p>It's nice and simple. It looks great written, and I can tell it to
someone over the phone without having to repeat bits of it.</p>

<p><strong>Were you actively waiting for the opening up of fastmail.com on the
day?</strong></p>

<p>I'm a little embarrassed to admit I had some help on this one. I had a
program monitoring the FastMail website for the exact moment
fastmail.com became available, so that I could register my address
straight away. Is this taking email too seriously?</p>

<p><strong>Do you plan to use your new @fastmail.com address as your primary
address? Have you told people about it yet?</strong></p>

<p>It'll be my new personal address to give out to people online and in
person. I've only told a few people so far, but it will get more and
more use over time.</p>

<hr />

<p>We’ve sent Joe a <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/fastmail/shop/t-shirts">T-Shirt from our RedBubble
store</a> for his
time.</p>

<p>Of course there’s always going to be a rush for the most popular names,
so we hope everyone managed to get the
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com">fastmail.com</a> address they wanted. If not,
remember you can also signup your own domain (personally, we use
<a href="http://www.gandi.net/">gandi.net</a>) and use that for receiving email
(Enhanced or higher personal accounts, or any Family/Business accounts
required).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>The FastMail Team</p>
