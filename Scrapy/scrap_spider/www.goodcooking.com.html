						<h3>French Cheese</h3>
						<p>France 
						produces almost 400 different varieties of cheese, each 
						one is as distinctive as a finger print. This wide 
						selection — more than any other country has to offer — 
						includes cheeses made from cow’s, ewe’s or goat’s milk, 
						or in combination. Each region has its specialty — 
						Normandy, France’s kingdom of milk and cream, is famous 
						for unctuous Camembert and Pont l’Evêque; the Loire 
						Valley and Provence for the tangy goat’s milk cheeses; 
						Alsace for robust Munster; the Alpine region for firmer, 
						subtly-flavored cheeses, such as Reblochon and Beaumont; 
						the Paris area for the world’s most prestigious cheese, 
						Brie — even from the Pyrénées comes Chiberta, firm, 
						slightly nutty- flavored, a specialty of which the hardy 
						Basque people are proud.</p>

						<p>Each region’s specialty is made according to tradition 
						which has existed for centuries. The professional 
						cheese- maker learns his craft as painstakingly as an 
						attorney the law. France’s reputation for being a 
						paradise for cheese lovers is well-deserved. Today, 
						Americans are fortunate because they need no longer be 
						on the original spot to relish their favorites — they 
						can readily find them at local cheese retailers. . . 
						almost 100 different varieties. Store such as Whole 
						Foods Markets have great selections. <br>
						<br>
						You may enter Good Cooking's Cheese Store and purchase 
						any one of 60 plus French Cheeses from the French Cheese 
						Selections. </p>

						<p>Here is just one of the 66 French Cheeses you can 
						choose from--- </p>
						<p>
						<img border="0" src="gc_picts/cantal.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Wheel of Cantel Cheese"></p>
						<p>Cantal is one of the oldest French Cheeses, predating 
						both Roquefort (11th Century) and Livarot (13th 
						Century).&nbsp; <br>
						<p>Double and triple crème cheeses, what Americans call 
						cream cheese is a very distant relative to these rich, 
						creamy, fresh cheeses from France. They vary in texture 
						from thick, heavy sour or fresh cream, to semi-firm 
						cream. All are delicate with a refreshing tang. Many 
						varieties are blended with a mixture of herbs and garlic 
						or spices, such as pepper.<align="center"></p>
						<p><strong>Double and Triple Creme Cheeses:</strong></p>
							<p>According to French law these cheeses are classified 
						double crème when they contain a minimum of 60 per cent 
						butter fat (rnatière grasse) per gram, and triple crème 
						when they contain a minimum of 75 per cent butter fat 
						per gram.</p>
							<p>These crèmes are delightful at any time of day, for any 
						menu or snack. Simply spread on crusty French bread, per 
						haps serve with fresh fruits in season (not citrus). 
						Fruity wines are ideal to accompany these cheeses, 
						particularly rosé. Many Americans enjoy the herbed or 
						peppered versions of these cheeses at the cocktail hour. 
						Among the crèmes available are: <br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Bellétoile</span> - - A soft-ripened triple crème, with no 
						rind, it is easily spreadable. It comes as 5-oz. round, 
						plain or herb-flavored.<br>
							<span class="style1">Boursault</span> - - Another triple crème, soft-ripened cheese 
						available in an 8-oz. round. This cheese is very creamy 
						almost like a mixture of Brie and heavy cream.<br>
							<span class="style1">Boursin</span> -- A fresh cow’s milk, double crème, white with an 
						edible crust. It has a tangy flavor and is available 
						with herbs or pepper.<br>
							<span class="style1">Brillat-Savarin</span> - - From Normandy, this triple crème is 
						a thick, plump, white disk, with a buttery texture and 
						elasticity.<br>
							<span class="style1">Excelsior</span> - - Similar to Boursin and Boursault, without 
						spices or herbs. Contains 72 percent butter fat and 
						comes in an 8-oz. cylinder.<br>
						Fromage de Monsieur Fromage - -&nbsp; A small round, double 
						crème, first made in Normandy about 75 years ago.<br>
							<span class="style1">Gervais</span> - - Usually packaged in squares or rectangles. 
						Its texture is similar to that of American-type cream 
						cheese, but its flavor is richer and slightly tangy.<br>
							<span class="style1">La Bouille</span> - - This rich, triple crème is not flavored, 
						but has its own special tang. The 1 l-oz. round is 
						available in a wood-chip basket.<br>
							<span class="style1">La Bourse</span> - - This is a triple crème, flavored with 
						herbs and garlic. It is round and available either in 
						2’/2- oz. or 5-oz. portions.<br>
							<span class="style1">Margotin</span> - - This crème is a mixture of cow’s and 
						goat’s milk, which makes it a less fatty, drier cheese. 
						It is either flavored with herbs or with pepper.<br>
							<span class="style1">Petit Suisse</span> - - One of France’s most popular double 
						crèmes, this cheese may contain from 60 to 75 per cent 
						butter fat. Available in l-oz. plastic cups.<br>
							<span class="style1">Provencal</span> - - Another triple crème, available as a 
						5-oz. round cheese in a cardboard box. It is flavored 
						either with herbs and garlic or with pepper.<br>
							<span class="style1">Tartare</span> - - This fresh, very creamy triple crème is 
						only available flavored with herbs and garlic.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Soft Cheeses:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>These exquisite cheeses are the result of French 
						cheese-making genius. They are known as soft paste 
						cheeses, usually having a white powdery crust which, 
						when ripened, is tinged reddish brown and the center is 
						soft to the touch. Inside, the cheese is golden yellow, 
						creamy, buttery smooth and “runny”. Once the crust is 
						cut, the cheese ceases to ripen.<br>
							</p>
							<p>As with all French cheeses, this type must be served at 
						room temperature. Again serve them with crusty French 
						bread, apples, grapes, peaches or pears, and for most of 
						them a light to medium French red wine makes an ideal 
						accompaniment.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Bibress</span> - - A cylinder-shaped creamy cheese with a 
						flavor similar to a mild blue cheese.<br>
							<span class="style1">Brie</span> - - The “King” of soft-ripened cheeses. Its 
						powdery, white edible crust becomes tinged reddish brown 
						when the cheese is fully ripened. As with each of this 
						type of cheese, it reaches its peak at room temperature.<br>
							<span class="style1">Brie de Meaux</span> - - One of the original, authentic Brie 
						cheeses, named after the city in which it is made.<br>
							<span class="style1">Brie de Melun</span> - - Another authentic variety of this 
						famous cheese, also named after the city where it is 
						made.<br>
							<span class="style1">Bache Lorraine</span> - - Similar to Brie in texture and 
						flavor, is available in the shape of a log.<br>
							<span class="style1">Cambree</span> - - This newcomer is a combination of Brie and 
						Camembert, with 50 per cent butter fat. It comes in a 
						rectangular loaf which weighs six pounds.<br>
							<span class="style1">Camembert</span> - - One of France’s most popular cheeses of 
						this variety, known and admired throughout the world. 
						Available in an 8-oz. round, it is an original specialty 
						of the province of Normandy.<br>
							<span class="style1">Caprice des Dieux</span> - - An oval-shaped cheese, slightly 
						creamier than Camembert with an edible crust.<br>
							<span class="style1">Carre de 1’ Est</span> - - A square-shaped cheese, similar in 
						flavor to Brie, but milder. As with most of this 
						variety, the crust is edible.<br>
							<span class="style1">Chaource</span> - - A specialty of Champagne country, this 
						cheese is creamy, plump and round in shape. Its white 
						crust is edible.<br>
							<span class="style1">Coulommiers</span> - - Made in the same region as Brie, it is 
						smaller in size, plumper than its cousin, but similar in 
						flavor and texture.<br>
							<span class="style1">Fol Amour</span> - - An oval-shaped cheese, made in the north of 
						France, and similar to Brie in flavor and texture.<br>
							<span class="style1">St. Benoit</span> - - A specialty of the area of Orleans, it 
						is made from skimmed cow’s milk and is in the shape of a 
						small, thick disk. Inside it is ivory-colored and very 
						creamy.<br>
							<span class="style1">Valdieue</span> - - This cheese is a close cousin to Carré de 
						1’ Est, in shape, size and flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Valmeuse</span> - - This is again in the Brie family, but it 
						contains a special stabilizer to retard ammoniation.<br>
						<br>
							<strong>Semi-Soft Cheeses:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>These are cheeses which are semi-firm to the touch, with 
						a smooth, buttery texture inside that yields on finger 
						pressure, or when cut with a knife. They are mild in 
						flavor with a clean, fresh tang to them that varies in 
						strength depending on the age. Because they slice easily 
						(especially when the knife blade has been dipped in very 
						hot water),
						they have good melting qualities and are often used in 
						cooking. But they are excellent as well for snacks, 
						dessert courses with bread and fruit and a modest French 
						red wine. Most semi-soft cheeses have an inedible crust.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Babybeh</span> - - Made from cow’s milk, this cheese is firm 
						in texture and retains its freshness because it is 
						enveloped in a red parrafin wrapper. It has a slightly 
						nutty flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Bonbel</span> - - Also made from cow’s milk, this is firm in 
						texture and has a yellow paraffin wrapper. Slightly 
						larger than its cousin, Babybel, this cheese, too is 
						slightly nutty in flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Chiberta</span> - - - A specialty of the Basque country, in the 
						south of France, this cheese is made from cow’s milk, is 
						ivory-colored on the inside with tiny holes. It is avail 
						able in a four-pound round and has a dark orange 
						inedible crust.<br>
							<span class="style1">Livarot</span> - - A famous specialty of the province of 
						Norman dy, this is a round cheese with a strong and 
						piquant flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Edam Français</span> - - Rich orange in color with a red rind 
						and a distinct nutty flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Munster</span> - - From the province of Alsace, this cheese 
						has a strong aroma but is milder in taste. Square-shaped 
						and rather orange-y in color, it is sometimes flavored 
						with cumin or caraway.<br>
							<span class="style1">Pont l’Evêque</span> - - Again a Norman specialty, the name 
						of the cheese means Bishop’s Bridge. It is square shaped 
						with impressions on its usually edible rind which result<br>
						from the straw on which it is ripened.<br>
							<span class="style1">Port Salut</span> - - Originated by the Trappist monks in 
						their Monastery of Port-du-Salut&nbsp;<br>
						Entrammes, this popular cheese comes in a four-pound 
						round with an inedible orange rind. It slices readily 
						and is ideal in recipes.<br>
							<span class="style1">Reblochon</span> - -&nbsp; Made in the French Alps, the name 
						derives from the term for the second-milking of the day, 
						the cow’s milk, which is used to make this cheese. A 
						small, flat disk, it is mild in flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Royaldieue</span> - - Similar in texture and body to Port Salut but has a higher butter fat content. The crust is 
						not edible.<br>
							<span class="style1">St. Nectaire</span> - - Again, a cousin to Port Salut but its 
						inedible crust is darkish brown.<br>
							<span class="style1">St. Paulin</span> - - Another look-alike to Port Salut, in 
						shape and flavor, but it does not have an orange crust. 
						This cheese is also a creation of the Trappist monks.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Goat's Milk Cheeses---Chevres:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>These cheeses are much prized by connoisseurs and almost 
						every region of France has its own special goat’s milk 
						cheese. They are found in many sizes and shapes, such as 
						3- to 8-inch round patties, log-shaped, drum-shaped, 
						pyramids, rounds, loaves, etc. Textures vary from soft, 
						but firm, somewhat like cream cheese, to extremely hard.<br>
							</p>
	<p>Chevres make excellent dessert cheeses, served with 
						bread and fruit. The French wines recommended to drink 
						with these unique cheeses are modest white wines or 
						rosés.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Banon</span> - - A round flat disk in small and large sizes, 
						this cheese is a specialty of&nbsp;<br>
						Provence. It is wrapped in chest nut leaves and tied 
						with raffia.<br>
							<span class="style1">Capricette</span> - - This is a fresh goat cheese, with a low 
						fat content and a delightful tangy flavor. Available in 
						4-oz. plastic cups.<br>
							<span class="style1">Chabichou</span> - - Small cone-shaped, soft goat cheese, 
						which is ideal for dessert. It is made in the Poitou 
						region, and its flavor varies from fruity to sharp 
						depending on its age.<br>
							<span class="style1">Chèvre au Poivre—aux Herbes</span> 
							- - These patty-shaped 
						cheeses are sprinkled with pepper, fennel and rosemary. 
						All are excellent as hors d’oeuvre.<br>
							<span class="style1">Chevrotin</span> - - A popular cheese of this variety. It has 
						a fat content of 45 per cent, mild aroma, with a creamy 
						texture and nutty flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Montrachet</span> - - This is made in the province of 
						Burgundy, and always comes in the shape of a log. Mild 
						and creamy in flavor with a rind that may or may not be 
						dusted with vine wood ash. Good keeping quality.<br>
							<span class="style1">Pyramide</span> - - Sometimes called Valençay, this is, as 
						its name implies a pyramid-shaped cheese. It has a mild 
						nutty flavor and also its edible rind may or may not be 
						dusted with wood ash.<br>
							<span class="style1">St. Marcellin</span> - - Originally this cheese, from the Isère 
						Valley, was made strictly from goat’s milk. Today, it is 
						more often a combination of cow and goat. It is a soft 
						round disk, with a mild slightly acid flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Sainte Maure</span> - - A soft-ripened goat cheese, 
						log-shaped, with a thin edible crust and a mild flavor 
						which becomes more pronounced as it ages. It is 
						sometimes called Tonnelets.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Blue Cheeses:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>These cheeses have a blue vein marbling mostly developed 
						by natural fermentation processes, sometimes by 
						inoculation to start or hasten ripening, and maturing. 
						The term persillé, which is often applied to these 
						cheeses, has nothing to do with parsley. Rather it 
						refers to the blue- green veining which resembles 
						parsley. These cheeses have a tangy flavor, some more 
						than others, are usually semi-soft, often crumbly, 
						especially when cold. Natural blue cheeses are produced 
						in many areas of France and are named after their region 
						or origin.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Most blue-veined cheeses are marvelous with fruit, 
						crusty bread or unsalted crackers, either for snacks, 
						hors d’oeuvre or as a dessert course. Their robust 
						flavor calls for a full-bodied French red wine. In the 
						U.S. these cheeses are widely used in salads and salad 
						dressings.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Bleu d’Auvergne</span> - - From the mountains of the rustic 
						region of the Auvergne, this cheese is made from cow’s 
						milk. It has a rich, sharp flavor.<br>
							<span class="style1">Bleu de Bresse</span> - - Also made from cow’s milk in the 
						region of Bresse, this cheese is available either in 
						cylinders or long loaves. It has a mild-ish flavor for 
						this type of cheese.<br>
							<span class="style1">Pipo Creme</span> - - This cheese, available in six-pound 
						rolls, has a very distinct flavor, slices easily as it 
						does not crumble. The thin crust is edible.<br>
							<span class="style1">Roquefort</span> - -
						The “King” of cheeses — as it is known throughout the 
						world. Made exclusively from ewe’s milk in the south of 
						France and aged and ripened in the limestone caves of 
						the small village of Roquefort. It is unique — unlike 
						any other cheese in flavor and texture. Authentic 
						Roquefort can be easily identified by the red sheep 
						emblem on the label.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Firm Texture Cheeses:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>These cheeses are used very often in gratineé dishes, as 
						an ingredient in many recipes, and are very popular in 
						sandwiches, or as snacks. Usually they have many “eyes”, 
						the size of which is helpful in identifying the various 
						kinds.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Beaumont</span> - - A specialty of the Savoie region of 
						France, this cheese has a distinct nutty flavor. It has 
						a tannish crust which is not edible. Inside, the ivory 
						colored cheese has many tiny “eyes” arranged close 
						together.<br>
							<span class="style1">Comte</span> - - A product of the Jura region, it is similar 
						to Emmental. It comes in large, fiat wheels which 
						may weigh as much as 75 pounds. (In France Gruyère is 
						the generic term for this cheese.)<br>
							<span class="style1">Emmental Français</span> - - Identified by its eyes which are 
						relatively large. This cheese has a nut-like tang that 
						adds zest to such dishes as quiches, fondues and sauces.<br>
							<span class="style1">Mimolette</span> - -&nbsp; Made in the north of France from cow’s 
						milk, it is about the size and shape of Edam. In texture 
						and flavor, however, it is more similar to cheddar. Out 
						side it is orange and inside a bright yellow.<br>
							<span class="style1">Tomme des Pyrénées</span> - - A cheese from France’s Basque 
						country, it is a large round cow’s milk cheese, with an 
						inedible black rind.<br>
							<span class="style1">Tomme de Savoie</span> - - From the Alpine region, this cheese 
						is made from cow’s milk and has a low fat content. It is 
						firm, subtly flavored and comes in a flat, round dislC 
						which weighs about four to six pounds.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Hard Cheeses:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Cantal</span> - - A native of the Auvergne region, this is one 
						of France’s oldest and most famous cheeses. Has a 
						piquant flavor but its hard crust is not edible. It is 
						low in fat and high in protein — making it an excellent 
						choice for dieters. Fine for cooking or as a simple 
						table cheese with bread and red wine. A wheel may weigh 
						as much as 100 pounds.<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Process Cheese:</strong><br>
							</p>
							<p>Most of France’s process cheeses are a blend with a 
						creme de Gruyère as as base. They may have a firm, heavy 
						texture, or may be soft, smooth and spreadable.<br>
							</p>
							<p><span class="style1">Beau Pasteur</span> - - This cheese has a mild, distinct 
						flavor, a creamy buttery texture and no crust. It is 
						available in a three-pound round.<br>
							<span class="style1">Fondu au Raisin</span> - - A semi-soft cheese with a 
						distinctive grape flavor imparted by its rind (inedible) 
						of grape seeds, called “marc” — the remains from the 
						pressed grapes.<br>
							<span class="style1">Gourmandise</span> - -&nbsp; Similar to Beau Pasteur with either a 
						cherry or walnut flavor. A party and dessert favorite.<br>
							<span class="style1">La Grappe</span> - -&nbsp; Another name for the cheese called Fondu 
						au Raisin.<br>
							<span class="style1">La Vache Qui Rit</span> - - Which means “laughing cow”, a 
						picture of which appears on the label. This has become 
						an American favorite. It is available in cocktail-size 
						pieces or in packages of individual wedge-shaped 
						portions.<br>
							<span class="style1">Nec Plus Ultra</span> - - Similar in texture and quality to Gourmandise. It is served in the same manner, and also 
						is available in cherry or walnut flavors.<br>
							<span class="style1">Six de Savoie</span> - - Similar to La Vache Qui Rit, it is pack 
						aged in small triangular wedges.<br>
							<span class="style1">Tomme au Marc</span> - - Same as Fondu au Raisin.<br>
