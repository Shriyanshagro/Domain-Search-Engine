<p>You are probably, like me, getting tired of the different predictions for 2016. So I’m not going to do my usual look forward for the year for individual developments in online learning. Instead, I want to raise a fundamental question about which direction online learning should be heading in the future, because the next year could turn out to be very significant in determining the future of online learning.</p>
<p>The key question we face is whether online learning should aim to replace teachers and instructors through automation, or whether technology should be used to empower not only teachers but also learners. Of course, the answer will always be a mix of both, but getting the balance right is critical.</p>
<h2><strong>An old but increasingly important question</strong></h2>
<p>This question, automation or human empowerment, is not new. It was raised by B.F. Skinner (1968) when he developed teaching machines in the early 1960s. He thought teaching machines would eventually replace teachers. On the other hand, Seymour Papert (1980) wanted computing to empower learners, not to teach them directly. In the early 1980s Papert got children to write computer code to improve the way they think and to solve problems. Papert was strongly influenced by Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, and in particular that children constructed rather than absorbed knowledge.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, as personal computers became more common, computer-assisted learning (CAL or CAD) became popular, using computer-marked tests and early forms of adaptive learning. Also in the 1980s the first developments in artificial intelligence were applied, in the form of intelligent math tutoring. Great predictions were made then, as now, about the potential of AI to replace teachers.</p>
<p>Then along came the Internet. Following my first introduction to the Internet in a friend’s basement in Vancouver, I published an article in the first edition of the <em>Journal of Distance Education</em>, entitled ‘Computer-assisted learning or communications: which way for IT in distance education?’ (1986). In this paper I argued that the real value of the Internet and computing was to enable asynchronous interaction and communication between teacher and learners, and between learners themselves, rather than as teaching machines. This push towards a more constructivist approach to the use of computing in education was encapsulated in Mason and Kaye’s book, Mindweave (1989). Linda Harasim has since argued that online collaborative learning is an important theory of learning in its own right (Harasim, 2012).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, David Noble of York University attacked online learning in particular for turning universities into ‘Digital Diploma Mills’:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘universities are not only undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher education.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Noble (1998) argued that</p>
<blockquote><p>‘high technology, at these universities, is often used not to ……improve teaching and research, but to replace the visions and voices of less-prestigious faculty with the second-hand and reified product of academic &#8220;superstars&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, contrary to Noble’s warnings, for fifteen years most university online courses followed more the route of interaction and communication between teachers and students than computer-assisted learning or video lectures, and Noble’s arguments were easily dismissed or forgotten.</p>
<p>Then along came lecture capture and with it, in 2011, Massive Open Online Courses (xMOOCs) from Coursera, Udacity and edX, driven by elite, highly selective universities, with their claims of making the best professors in the world available to everyone for free. Noble&#8217;s nightmare suddenly became very real. At the same time, these MOOCs have resulted in much more interest in big data, learning analytics, a revival of adaptive learning, and claims that artificial intelligence will revolutionize education, since automation is essential for managing such massive courses.</p>
<p>Thus we are now seeing a big swing back to the automation of learning, driven by powerful computing developments, Silicon Valley start-up thinking, and a sustained political push from those that want to commercialize education (more on this later). Underlying these developments is a fundamental conflict of philosophies and pedagogies, with automation being driven by an objectivist/behaviourist view of the world, compared with the constructivist approaches of online collaborative learning.</p>
<p>In other words, there are increasingly stark choices to be made about the future of online learning. Indeed, it is almost too late &#8211; I fear the forces of automation are winning &#8211; which is why 2016 will be such a pivotal year in this debate.</p>
<h2><strong>Automation and the commercialization of education</strong></h2>
<p>These developments in technology are being accompanied by a big push in the United States, China, India and other countries towards the commercialization of online learning. In other words, education is being seen increasingly as a commodity that can be bought and sold. This is not through the previous and largely discredited digital diploma mills of the for-profit online universities such as the University of Phoenix that David Noble feared, but rather through the encouragement and support of commercial computer companies moving into the education field, companies such as Coursera, Lynda.com and Udacity.</p>
<p>Audrey Watters and EdSurge both produced lists of EdTech ‘deals’ in 2015 totalling between $1-$2 billion. Yes, that’s right, that’s $1-$2 billion in investment in private ed tech companies in the USA (and China) in one year alone. At the same time, entrepreneurs are struggling to develop sustainable business models for ed tech investment, because with education funded publicly, a ‘true’ market is restricted. Politicians, entrepreneurs and policy makers on the right in the USA increasingly see a move to automation as a way of reducing government expenditure on education, and one means by which to ‘free up the market’.</p>
<p>Another development that threatens the public education model is the move by very rich entrepreneurs such as the Gates, the Hewletts and the Zuckerbergs to move their massive personal wealth into ‘charitable’ foundations or corporations and use this money for their pet ‘educational’ initiatives that also have indirect benefits for their businesses. Ian McGugan (2015) in the Globe and Mail newspaper estimates that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> is worth potentially $45 billion, and one of its purposes is to promote the personalization of learning (another name hi-jacked by computer scientists; it&#8217;s a more human way of describing adaptive learning). Since one way Facebook makes its money is by selling personal data, forgive my suspicions that the Zuckerberg initiative is a not-so-obvious way of collecting data on future high earners. At the same time, the Chang Zuckerberg initiative enables the Zuckerberg’s to avoid paying tax on their profits from Facebook. Instead then of paying taxes that could be used to support public education, these immensely rich foundations enable a few entrepreneurs to set the agenda for how computing will be used in education.</p>
<h2><strong>Why not?</strong></h2>
<p>Technology is disrupting nearly every other business and profession, so why not education? Higher education in particular requires a huge amount of money, mostly raised through taxes and tuition fees, and it is difficult to tie results directly to investment. Surely we should be looking at ways in which technology can change higher education so that it is more accessible, more affordable and more effective in developing the knowledge and skills required in today’s and tomorrow’s society?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It is not so much the need for change that I am challenging, but the means by which this change is being promoted. In essence, a move to automated learning, while saving costs, will not improve the learning that matters, and particularly the outcomes needed in a digital age, namely, the high level intellectual skills of critical thinking, innovation, entrepreneurship, problem-solving , high-level multimedia communication, and above all, effective knowledge management.</p>
<p>To understand why automated approaches to learning are inappropriate to the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century we need to look particularly at the tools and methods being proposed.</p>
<h2><strong>The problems with automating learning</strong></h2>
<p>The main challenge for computer-directed learning such as information transmission and management through Internet-distributed video lectures, computer-marked assessments, adaptive learning, learning analytics, and artificial intelligence is that they are based on a model of learning that has limited applications. Behaviourism works well in assisting rote memory and basic levels of comprehension, but does not enable or facilitate deep learning, critical thinking and the other skills that are essential for learners in a digital age.</p>
<p>R. and D. Susskind (2015) in particular argue that there is a new age in artificial intelligence and adaptive learning driven primarily by what they call the brute force of more powerful computing. Why AI failed so dramatically in the 1980s, they argue, was because computer scientists tried to mimic the way that humans think, and computers then did not have the capacity to handle information in the way they do now. When however we use the power of today&#8217;s computing, it can solve previously intractable problems through analysis of massive amounts of data in ways that humans had not considered.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this argument. The first is that the Susskinds are correct in that computers operate differently from humans. Computers are mechanical and work basically on a binary operating system. Humans are biological and operate in a far more sophisticated way, capable of language creation as well as language interpretation, and use intuition as well as deductive thinking. Emotion as well as memory drives human behaviour, including learning. Furthermore humans are social animals, and depend heavily on social contact with other humans for learning. In essence humans learn differently from the way machine automation operates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computer scientists frequently ignore or are unaware of the research into human learning. In particular they are unaware that learning is largely developmental and constructed, and instead impose an old and less appropriate method of teaching based on behaviourism and an objectivist epistemology. If though we want to develop the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, we need a more constructivist approach to learning.</p>
<p>Supporters of automation also make another mistake in over-estimating or misunderstanding how AI and learning analytics operate in education. These tools reflect a highly objectivist approach to teaching, where procedures can be analysed and systematised in advance. However, although we know a great deal about learning in general, we still know very little about how thinking and decision-making operate biologically in individual cases. At the same time, although brain research is promising to unlock some of these secrets, most brain scientists argue that while we are beginning to understand the relationship between brain activity and very specific forms of behaviour, there is a huge distance to travel before we can explain how these mechanisms affect learning in general or how an individual learns in particular. There are too many variables (such as emotion, memory, perception, communication, as well as neural activity) at play to find an isomorphic fit between the firing of neurons and computer &#8216;intelligence&#8217;.</p>
<p>The danger then with automation is that we drive humans to learn in ways that best suit how machines operate, and thus deny humans the potential of developing the higher levels of thinking that make humans different from machines. For instance, humans are better than machines at dealing with volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous situations, which is where we find ourselves in today’s society.</p>
<p>Lastly, both AI and adaptive learning depend on algorithms that predict or direct human behaviour. These algorithms though are not transparent to the end users. To give an example, learning analytics are being used to identify students at high risk of failure, based on correlations of previous behaviour online by previous students. However, for an individual, should a software program be making the decision as to whether that person is suitable for higher education or a particular course? If so, should that person know the grounds on which they are considered unsuitable and be able to challenge the algorithm or at least the principles on which that algorithm is based? Who makes the decision about these algorithms – a computer scientist using correlated data, or an educator concerned with equitable access? The more we try to automate learning, the greater the danger of unintended consequences, and the more need for educators rather than computer scientists to control the decision-making.</p>
<h2><strong>The way forward</strong></h2>
<p>In the past, I used to think of computer scientists as colleagues and friends in designing and delivering online learning. I am now increasingly seeing at least some of them as the enemy. This is largely to do with the hubris of Silicon Valley, which believes that computer scientists can solve any problem without knowing anything about the problem itself. MOOCs based on recorded lectures are a perfect example of this, being developed primarily by a few computer scientists from Stanford (and unfortunately blindly copied by many people in universities who should have known better.)</p>
<p>We need to start with the problem, which is how do we prepare learners for the knowledge and skills they will need in today’s society. I have argued (Bates, 2015) that we need to develop, in very large numbers of people, high level intellectual and practical skills that require the construction and development of knowledge, and that enable learners to find, analyse, evaluate and apply knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>This requires a constructivist approach to learning which cannot be appropriately automated, as it depends on high quality interaction between knowledge experts and learners. There are many ways to accomplish this, and technology can play a leading role, by enabling easy access to knowledge, providing opportunities for practice in experientially-based learning environments, linking communities of scholars and learners together, providing open access to unlimited learning resources, and above all by enabling students to use technology to access, organise and demonstrate their knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>These activities and approaches do not easily lend themselves to massive economies of scale through automation, although they do enable more effective outcomes and possibly some smaller economies of scale. Automation can be helpful in developing some of the foundations of learning, such as basic comprehension or language acquisition. But at the heart of developing the knowledge and skills needed in today’s society, the role of a human teacher, instructor or guide will remain absolutely essential. Certainly, the roles of teachers and instructors will need to change quite dramatically, teacher training and faculty development will be critical for success, and we need to use technology to enable students to take more responsibility for their own learning, but it is a dangerous illusion to believe that automation is the solution to learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<h2><strong>Protecting the future</strong></h2>
<p>There are several practical steps that need to be taken to prevent the automation of teaching.</p>
<ol>
<li>Educators – and in particular university presidents and senior civil servants with responsibility for education – need to speak out clearly about the dangers of automation, and the technology alternatives available that still exploit its potential and will lead to greater cost-effectiveness. This is not an argument against the use of technology in education, but the need to use it wisely so we get the kind of educated population we need in the 21st century.</li>
<li>Computer scientists need to show more respect to educators and be less arrogant. This means working collaboratively with educators, and treating them as equals.</li>
<li>We – teachers and educational technologists – need to apply in our own work and disseminate better to those outside education what we already know about effective learning and teaching.</li>
<li>Faculty and teachers need to develop compelling technology alternatives to automation that focus on the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, such as:
<ul>
<li>experiential learning through virtual reality (e.g. Loyalist College&#8217;s training of border service agents)</li>
<li>networking learners online with working professionals, to solve real world problems (e.g. by developing a program similar to McMaster&#8217;s integrated science program for online/blended delivery)</li>
<li>building strong communities of practice through connectivist MOOCs (e.g. on climate change or mental health) to solve global problems</li>
<li>empowering students to use social media to research and demonstrate their knowledge through multimedia e-portfolios (e.g. UBC&#8217;s ETEC 522)</li>
<li>designing openly accessible high quality, student-activated simulations and games but designed and monitored by experts in the subject area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governments need to put as much money into research into learning and educational technology as they do into innovation in industry. Without better and more defensible theories of learning suitable for a digital age, we are open to any quack or opportunist who believes he or she has the best snake oil. More importantly, with better theory and knowledge of learning disseminated and applied appropriately, we can have a much more competitive workforce and a more just society.</li>
<li>We need to educate our politicians about the dangers of commercialization in education through the automation of learning and fight for a more equal society where the financial returns on technology applications are more equally shared.</li>
<li>Become <a href="http://www.utne.com/politics/meet-the-edupunks-radical-self-education.aspx">edupunks</a> and take back the web from powerful commercial interests by using open source, low cost, easy to use tools in education that protect our privacy and enable learners and teachers to control how they are used.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should keep you busy in 2016.</p>
<p>Your views are of course welcome – unless you are a bot.</p>

<p>Contact North has organised a series of four webinars highlighting the practical advice and guidelines offered in my online, open textbook, <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>. The first webinar took place last week on September 29. It covered the first five chapters in the book, which discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>the implications of the major changes taking place in education</li>
<li>epistemologies that drive approaches to teaching and learning</li>
<li>different teaching methods and their appropriateness for developing the knowledge and skills needed in a knowledge-based society.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the webinar was not to cover the same ground as in the book,  but to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions or comments about these issues, which was what they did. I received and answered nearly 30 different questions in the one hour. You can access the recording here: <a href="https://contactnorth.webex.com/contactnorth/lsr.php?RCID=67ca245af5fa7a21546ba37e10f306ba">https://contactnorth.webex.com/contactnorth/lsr.php?RCID=67ca245af5fa7a21546ba37e10f306ba</a></p>
<p>In particular, there were questions about the importance of passion in teaching, whether learners today are really different, how to engage passive learners or introverts online, how to get students to take responsibility for learning, how to get students to collaborate online, and lastly whether cognitivism is an epistemology or a learning theory. I did answer all these questions briefly within the webinar.</p>
<p>On listening again to the recording, though, I was struck by the interest or concern of participants for what I would call the intangibles or the more human aspects in teaching and learning, such as the importance of passion in teaching and learning, dealing with learners&#8217; &#8216;readiness&#8217; or motivation to learn, building relationships between online learners and instructors, and how to encourage/develop interaction, discussion and collaboration between learners.</p>
<p>This brought home to me that for most instructors, teaching is not just a technical activity that can be categorized, systematised and computerised, but is a fundamentally human practice that requires empathy, intuition, and imagination. These are qualities that cannot be automated.</p>
<p>The next webinar, which will cover chapters 6-9 on media and technology selection, will be on November 3, 2015. For more details, click <a href="https://contactnorth.webex.com/mw3000/mywebex/default.do?siteurl=contactnorth">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gisbert, T. and Bullen, M. (2015) <em>Teaching and Learning in Digital Worlds: Strategies and Issues in Higher Education</em> Tarragona Spain: <a href="http://www.publicacionsurv.cat">Publicacions Universitat Rovira i Virgili</a> (pdf version available online for 2.84 Euros).</p>
<h2>What the book is about</h2>
<p>From the Introduction</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[The book] examines the teaching and learning process in 3D virtual learning environments from both the theoretical and practical points of view. It is divided into four sections:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>the first section discusses education in the 21st century from the perspective of learners in a digital society and examines the basic competences students need to respond to the personal and professional challenges they are likely to face. It also explores the issue of quality&#8230;..</em></li>
<li><em>the second section focuses on the educational and teaching strategies higher education professionals must take into account when developing educational processes in technology environments&#8230;in such environments simulation will be our best teaching strategy and evaluation our greatest challenge.</em></li>
<li><em>the third section explores the use of 3D virtual environments in education in general and in higher education in particular&#8230;.</em></li>
<li><em>The fourth section examines the range of experiences we consider to be good practice when applying 3D technological environments to the teaching of competences at secondary and tertiary levels of education both nationally and internationally.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this doesn&#8217;t quite capture for me what the book is really about, so I will discuss a little more closely below some of the themes addressed by individual chapters.</p>
<p>As a point of clarification, I will use the term &#8216;immersive environments&#8217; as a shorthand to describe simulations, games and virtual reality, a point I will come back to in my comments at the end of this post.</p>
<h2>Who wrote it</h2>
<p>The book is edited by Mercè Gisbert of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Catalonia, Spain, and Canadian Mark Bullen, formerly of the University of British Columbia and the Commonwealth of Learning. However, the majority of chapters are based on a study (<a href="http://proyectosimula.blogspot.ca/">Simul@</a>) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and coordinated by Universitat Rovira i Virgili, but involving universities in Spain, Germany, and Portugal, thus providing a valuable insight into the thinking about immersive environments for education in Europe.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I wrote a short prologue for the book.</p>
<h2>Themes covered in the book</h2>
<p>Rather than a chapter-by-chapter summary, I have selected certain themes that re-occur through the book.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Digital learners</h3>
<p>There is a lot of discussion in the book about the nature of digital learners and their &#8216;readiness&#8217; for learning through digital technologies. In particular, Bullen and Morgan summarise the conflicting views and the research around digital natives and digital immigrants, and provide a more &#8216;nuanced&#8217; profile of categories of digital learners.  Martinez and Espinal in their chapter provide a detailed description of digital competence and how to assess it. Throughout the book there is emphasis on the need to ensure that learners have the necessary &#8216;digital competences&#8217; to benefit fully from the use of immersive technologies for learning purposes (although the same applies to teachers, of course). For instance, de Oliveira et al., in their chapter, identify various components of digital competences.</p>
<h3>2. Competences</h3>
<p>One of the strengths of the book is that several authors make the point that the main educational value of immersive learning environments is for the development of &#8216;general competences&#8217; such as learning to learn, teamwork, communication, problem solving and decision-making. Astigarraga provides a very good overview of the definition, identification and evaluation of competences, and Isus et al. develop this further with a chapter on evaluating the competences of teamwork and self-management. Larraz and Esteve devote their whole chapter to evaluating digital competence in immersive environments. These chapters will be valuable for anyone interested in competency-based learning, whether or not using immersive learning environments.</p>
<h3>3. Key educational principles and affordances of immersive technologies</h3>
<p>Another strength of the book is that several authors related the features of immersive environments to possible educational affordances, and the educational principles needed to exploit such affordances. Camacho and Esteve-Gonzáles have a list of 14 educational reasons for using immersive environments for learning and Cervera and Cela-Ranilla have collated from the general research literature about 15 key pedagogical principles &#8216;to be observed during learning processes&#8217; when using immersive technologies for learning purposes.</p>
<h3>4. Planning and implementing virtual learning environments</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the book there are several chapters focusing on more practical issues. Marqués et al. describe the planning and implementation of a virtual world built in Sloodle, which combines OpenSim with Moodle, for educating both physical education and business management students. Estevez-González et al. take this further with a chapter on the tools used in Sloodle and the necessary steps needed to integrate OpenSim and Moodle. Lastly, Cela-Ranilla and Estevez-Gonzàlez provide an educational rationale for the design of the project. Garcia and Martin set out a design methodology for an immersive learning environment.</p>
<h3>5. Experiences and good practices</h3>
<p>The book ends with five chapters that describe actual applications of immersive learning environments, including PolyU developed at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (hotel and tourism management), a review of applications in economics and business courses, the use of an educational platform Virt-UAM developed at Universidad Autònoma de Madrid, and applications in law and psychology, and lastly a review of applications in secondary/high school education.</p>
<h2>Critique</h2>
<p>First, this is a very welcome and timely publication for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it sets out very clearly the pedagogical rationale for the use of immersive learning environments;</li>
<li>it links immersive technologies very strongly to the development of competences;</li>
<li>it provides practical advice on the planning and implementation of immersive learning environments;</li>
<li>it provides a welcome European perspective on the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a personal perspective, it complements very nicely my own open, online textbook, <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>, where, because of space and time issues, I was unable to give this topic the treatment it deserves. Although not an open textbook, it is very accessible, available online for less than three euros ($3-4).</p>
<p>Given the book is mostly written by people for whom English is a second language, the chapters are clearly and well written, mostly free of the European English associated with European Commission projects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the European Commission has adopted the term competence rather than competency, which really irritates me, and this term is used throughout the book, when what the authors are really talking about are skills. Competent is an adjective meaning a minimal capacity to do something; incompetent is more frequently used in English English, and it is used to describe inadequacy. What we are really talking about here are skills, not competence. Skills have no limit, while competence tends to be categorical: you either have it or you don&#8217;t, which is why competency-based learning often requires 100% pass-rates. But skills such as problem-solving can get better and better, and that&#8217;s what we should be striving for in higher education, not a minimal pass requirement.</p>
<p>The editors have done a good job in ensuring that there is a coherence and progression between the different chapters, always a challenge in a multiple-authored book. However, I would have liked a summary chapter from the editors that pulled all the threads together, and also some more information about the authors.</p>
<p>The books strength and its weakness is the academic nature of the book, with more focus on theory, competences and affordances, and less on the actual technology design issues, although to be fair these start to appear at the back of the book. I would have liked to have seen more integration in the writing throughout the book between theory and practice.</p>
<p>The main omission is any discussion of costs in planning and developing immersive learning environments, which are time demanding of both learners and teachers. There are clear economies of scale that need to be employed to justify the high cost of initial design. If a virtual world and allied teaching strategies can be shared across several courses or even disciplines, the cost becomes more acceptable. There is also a high cost for students in terms of the time needed to master the technology and its educational applications if they only get one course in a virtual world. So it is a pity that there was so little discussion of costs and time in the book, and about the transfer of innovation into mainstream practice, which are significant challenges for the wider adoption of immersive technologies in education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is a book I would highly recommend to all concerned about the implications of technology for learning design. Virtual learning environments hold great promise. We need more concerted efforts in higher education to use immersive learning environments, and this book is an essential guide.</p>

<p>ACT (2105) <a href="http://www.act.org/research/policymakers/pdf/UnpackingCareerReadiness.pdf">Unpacking &#8220;Career Readiness&#8221;</a> Iowa City IA: Act Inc.</p>
<p>ACT Inc, the organisation that designs and administers the most widely used high school standardised tests in the USA, has just published a short but interesting document. In it, they state:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In the report <em>Broadening the Definition of College and Career Readiness: A Holistic Approach</em> (Mattern et al. 2014), ACT has begun to describe the skills needed for postsecondary success through a new model of learning readiness that encompasses at least four overlapping but distinct domains: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Core Academic Skills in English language arts, mathematics, and science </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cross-Cutting Capabilities such as critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, and information and technology skills </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Behavioral Skills related to success in education and the workforce, such as being dependable, working effectively with others, adapting, and managing stress </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Navigation Skills, or skills needed to successfully negotiate educational and career pathways, such as self-knowledge of abilities, likes and dislikes, and values; knowledge about majors, occupations, and future career opportunities; and the variety of skills related to educational and career exploration, planning, and decision making needed for long-term success in the workplace</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The documents also states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readiness assessments that focus solely on academic proficiency risk ignoring what education, business, and industry leaders have long recognized: behavioral and career skills and crosscutting capabilities are no less essential to success in the 21st-century college classroom and the workplace. The “life skills” framework suggested by this new model supports this holistic picture of readiness.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>It is good that ACT is raising the issue of the skills needed by learners and graduates in today&#8217;s society. Identifying the most important skills is an essential first step to ensuring that they get taught.</p>
<p>However, the paper raises more questions than it answers, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>is this the &#8216;right&#8217; list of skills? For instance, shouldn&#8217;t knowledge management and digital literacy (which is not the same as IT skills) be in there somewhere? And who should decide what skills are important?</li>
<li>is it the job of colleges and universities to teach these broader skills? I believe it is, but that raises further questions, such as:
<ul>
<li>do instructors currently have the knowledge, time and inclination to develop these new skills?</li>
<li>do these new skills replace or are they an addition to what schools and colleges are already teaching? What are the trade-offs that will be necessary if more focus is given to these skills?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what teaching methods are most likely to enable students to develop these skills?</li>
<li>what is the best way to measure or assess such skills?</li>
</ul>
<p>The last question is particularly important to ask, because I suspect ACT is looking to build standardised, computer assessments for such skills, but this may not be the most appropriate form of assessment.</p>
<p>My online open textbook, <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>, attempts to address at least some of these issues, but I don&#8217;t pretend that I have all the answers. It is good though that ACT is raising the issue of identifying and assessing these &#8216;soft&#8217; skills, even if there may be a commercial motive behind their research.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 12.7 is really a summary of the main points in the book, which I reproduce below as the key takeaways from the book.</p>
<p>I will do a separate post on Scenario G, which provides a possible future scenario for teaching in a digital age.</p>
<p>The book is by no means finished. I need to do some serious editing, but the book now exists in a form that can be used immediately for supporting faculty development, or for teachers and instructors interested in improving their teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>1. There is increasing pressure from employers, the business community, learners themselves, and also from  a significant number of educators, for learners to develop the type of knowledge and the kinds of skills that they will need in a digital age.</p>
<p>2. The knowledge and skills needed in a digital age, where all &#8216;content&#8217; will be increasingly and freely available over the Internet, requires graduates with expertise in:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge management (the ability to find, evaluate and appropriately apply knowledge),</li>
<li>IT knowledge and skills,</li>
<li>inter-personal communication skills, including the appropriate use of social media</li>
<li>independent and lifelong learning skills</li>
<li>a range of intellectual skills, including
<ul>
<li>knowledge construction</li>
<li>reasoning</li>
<li>critical analysis,</li>
<li>problem-solving,</li>
<li>creativity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>collaborative learning and teamwork</li>
<li>multi-tasking and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all skills that are relevant to any subject domain, and need to be embedded within that domain. With such skills, graduates will be better prepared for a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.</p>
<p>3. To develop such knowledge and skills, teachers and instructors need to set clear learning outcomes and select teaching methods  that will support the development of such knowledge and skills, and, since all skills require practice and feedback to develop, learners must be given ample opportunity to practice such skills. This requires moving away from a model of information transmission to greater student engagement, more learner-centred teaching, and new methods of assessment that measure skills as well as mastery of content.</p>
<p>4. Because of the increased diversity of students, from full-time campus-based learners to lifelong learners already with high levels of post-secondary education to learners who have slipped through the formal school system and need second-chance opportunities, and because of the capacity of new information technologies to provide learning at any time and any place, a much wider range of modes of delivery are needed, such as campus-based teaching, blended or hybrid learning and fully online courses and programs, both in formal and in non-formal settings.</p>
<p>5. The move to blended, hybrid and online learning and a greater use of learning technologies offers more options and choices for teachers and instructors. In order to use these technologies well, teachers and instructors require not only to know the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of technology, but also need to have a good grasp of how students learn best. This requires knowing about</p>
<ul>
<li>the research into teaching and learning,</li>
<li>different theories of learning related to different concepts of knowledge (epistemology),</li>
<li>different methods of teaching and their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without this basic foundation, it is difficult for teachers and instructors to move away from the only model that many are familiar with, namely the lecture and discussion model, which is limited in terms of developing the knowledge and skills required in a digital age.</p>
<p>6. The challenge is particularly acute in universities. There is no requirement to have any training or qualification in teaching to work in a university in most Western countries. Nevertheless teaching will take up a minimum of 40 per cent of a faculty member&#8217;s time, and much more for many adjunct or contract faculty or full time college instructors. However, the same challenge remains, to a lesser degree, for school teachers and college instructors: how to ensure that already experienced professionals have the knowledge and skills required to teach well in a digital age.</p>
<p>7. Institutions can do much to facilitate or impede the development of the knowledge and skills required in a digital age. They need to</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that all levels of teaching and instructional staff have adequate training in the new technologies and methods of teaching necessary for the development of the knowledge and skills required in a digital age</li>
<li>ensure that there is adequate learning technology support for teachers and instructors</li>
<li>ensure that conditions of employment and in particular class size enable teaching and instructional staff to teach in the ways that will develop the knowledge and skills needed in a digital age</li>
<li>develop a practical and coherent institutional strategy to support he kind of teaching needed in a digital age.</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Although governments, institutions and learners themselves can do a great deal to ensure success in teaching and learning, in the end the responsibility and to some extent the power to change lies within teachers and instructors themselves.</p>
<p>9. It will be the imagination of teachers inventing new ways of teaching that will eventually result in the kinds of graduates the world will need in the future</p></blockquote>
<h2> Your turn</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m now in the final editing stages. The book will be available for review and I will be approaching some of the leading experts in this area to do a full critique and suggestions for improvement. But now is your chance. If you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>criticisms of what I&#8217;ve written</li>
<li>suggestions for adding things that I missed</li>
<li>suggestions for improvements to content</li>
<li>suggestions for improvements to the open textbook format</li>
<li>any other comments, negative or positive</li>
</ul>
<p>about the whole book, please let me know.</p>
