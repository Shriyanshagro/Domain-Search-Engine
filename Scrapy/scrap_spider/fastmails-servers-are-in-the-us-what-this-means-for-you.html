<p class="blog-author"><a href="https://twitter.com/robn">Rob Norris</a> &ndash;  7 October 2013</p>
<p>As you may be aware, there have been many reports recently of secret
data mining programs conducted by the US government. These reports have
included mention of secret network interception and "backdoor" access to
private email accounts. While we have no position on the veracity of
these claims, we have had many queries about what, if anything, this
might mean for us and for our customers, given that our primary servers
are located in the US. This is our response to those questions.</p>

<p>As noted in our <a href="https://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_privacy.html">recently updated privacy
policy</a>, we are an
Australian company subject to Australian law. We are required to
disclose information about specific individual accounts to properly
authorised Australian law enforcement with the appropriate supporting
documentation, which means a warrant signed by an Australian judge. We
do not co-operate with any kind of blanket surveillance, monitoring or
"fishing expeditions", and we do not give out user information to anyone
outside Australia.</p>

<p>There are some rare cases of overseas entities applying to Australian
authorities for information under a Mutual Assistance treaty. In that
case proper Australian documentation must be issued before we will do
anything. These cases are particularly rare because the burden of proof
required is very high, and the chain of events is very long (ultimately,
each case currently requires sign off from the Australian Attorney
General). The Mutual Assistance treaties also have (amongst other
things) a test of whether the putative offense would be illegal in
Australia, not just in their country of origin.</p>

<p>Australia does not have any equivalent to the US National Security
Letter, so we cannot be forced to do something without being allowed to
disclose it.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out to us that since we have our servers in the US,
we are under US jurisdiction. We do not believe this to be the case. We
do not have a legal presence in the US, no company incorporated in the
US, no staff in the US, and no one in the US with login access to any
servers located in the US. Even if a US court were to serve us with a
court order, subpoena or other instruction to hand over user data,
Australian communications and privacy law explicitly forbids us from
doing so.</p>

<p>It might be possible for the US government to lean on the Australian
government or other international legal body to compel us to hand over
data but this likely to be an expensive, time-consuming and highly
visible process. In our opinion those barriers make it extremely
unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>There are of course other avenues available to obtain your data. Our
colocation providers could be compelled to give physical access to our
servers. Network capturing devices could be installed. And in the worst
case an attacker could simply force their way into the datacentre and
physically remove our servers.</p>

<p>These are not things we can protect against directly but again, we can
make it extremely difficult for these things to occur by using strong
encryption and careful systems monitoring. Were anything like this ever
to happen we would be talking about it very publically. Such an action
would not remain secret for long.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, our opinion is that these kinds of attacks are no
different to any other hacking attempt. We can and will do everything in
our power to make getting unauthorised access to your data as difficult
and expensive as possible, but no online service provider can guarantee
that it will never happen.</p>

<p>As a customer, you need to weigh the benefits of keeping your data with
us against the risks of that data being disclosed. You may wish to
obtain private legal advice to help you assess that risk. And if you
come to the conclusion that keeping your data with us is too risky, then
we respect that (though please do tell us why!)</p>
