<p>I was asked by the Chang School of Continuing Studies at Ryerson University to do a master class on this topic at their <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/02/21/a-full-day-of-experiential-learning-in-action/">ChangSchoolTalks</a> on February 17, based on <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/part/chapter-5-building-an-effective-learning-environment/">Appendix 1</a> in my open, online textbook, <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>.</p>
<p>I was a little surprised by the request. I had moved what had originally been the second chapter of the book to an appendix, as I thought it was rather obvious and most instructors would already be aware of the key factors in an effective learning environment, so I was somewhat nervous about doing a master class for faculty and instructors on this topic.</p>
<p>As it turned out, I need not have worried. The master class was the first to be fully booked and the way the master class developed suggested that participants found the topic both stimulating and challenging. I think the reason for this is that my approach to building an effective learning environment is driven by a particular philosophy of education that is not always understood in post-secondary education. For this reason I thought I would share with you my thoughts on this in this post.</p>
<h2>Learning as a &#8216;natural&#8217; human activity</h2>
<p>One premise behind building an effective learning environment is that it is inbuilt in humans to learn. If we had not been reasonably good at learning, we would have been killed off early in the earth&#8217;s history by faster, bigger and more ferocious animals. The ability not only to learn, but to learn in abstract and conscious ways, is therefore part of human nature.</p>
<p>If that is the case, a teacher&#8217;s job is not to do the learning for the student, but to build a rich environment that facilitates the kind of learning that will benefit the learner. It is not a question of pouring knowledge into a student&#8217;s head, but enabling the learner to develop concepts, think critically, and apply and evaluate what they have learned, by providing opportunities and experiences that are relevant to such goals.</p>
<h2>Learning as development</h2>
<p>A second premise is that knowledge is not fixed or static, but is continually developing. Our concept of heat changes and becomes richer as we grow older and become more educated, from understanding heat through touch, to providing a quantitative way of measuring it, to understanding its physical properties, to being able to apply that knowledge to solving problems, such as designing refrigerators. In a knowledge-based society, knowledge is constantly developing and growing, and our understanding is always developing.</p>
<p>This is one reason why I believe that one negative aspect of competency-based education is its attempt to measure competencies in terms of &#8216;mastery&#8217; and limiting them to competencies required by employers. The difference between a skill and a competency is that there is no limit to a skill. You can continually improve a skill. We should be enabling students to develop skills that will carry them through maybe multiple employers, and enable them to adapt to changing market requirements, for instance.</p>
<p>If then we want students to develop knowledge and skills, we need to provide the right kind of learning environments  that encourage and support such development. Although analogies have their limitations, I like to think of education as gardening, where the learners are the plants. Plants know how to grow; they just need the right environment, the right balance of sun and shadow, the right soil conditions, enough water, etc. Our job as teachers is to make sure we are providing learners with those elements that will allow them to grow and learn. (The analogy breaks down though if we think of learners as having consciousness and free will, which adds an important element to developing an effective learning environment.)</p>
<h2>There are many possible effective learning environments</h2>
<p>Teaching is incredibly context-specific so the learning environment must be suitable to the context. For this reason, every teacher or instructor needs to think about and build their own learning environment that is appropriate to the context in which they are working. Here are some examples of different learning environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a school or college campus</li>
<li>an online course</li>
<li>military training</li>
<li>friends, family and work</li>
<li>nature</li>
<li>personal, technology-based, learning environments</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_10216" style="width: 558px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/wp-content/uploads/Personal-learning-environment-2-Janson-Hews-e1456172033305.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-10216"><img class="size-large wp-image-10216" src="http://www.tonybates.ca/wp-content/uploads/Personal-learning-environment-2-Janson-Hews-548x391.jpg" alt="A personal learning environment Image: jason Hews, Flikr" width="548" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A personal learning environment<br />Image: jason Hews, Flikr</p></div>
<p>Nevertheless I will argue that despite the differences in context, there are certain elements or components that will be found in most effective learning environments.</p>
<p>In developing an effective learning environment, there are two issues I need to address up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it is the learner who has to do the learning.</li>
<li>Second, any learning environment is much more than the technology used to support it.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to the first, teachers cannot do the learning for the learner. All they can do is to create and manage an environment that enables and encourages learning. My focus then in terms of building an effective learning environment is on what the  teacher can do, because in the end that is all they can control. However, the focus of what the teacher does should be on the learner, and what the learner needs. That of course will require good communication between the learners and the teacher.</p>
<p>Second, many technology-based personal learning environments are bereft of some of the key components that make an effective learning environment. The technology may be necessary but it is not sufficient. I suggest below what some of those components are.</p>
<h2>Key components</h2>
<p>These will vary somewhat, depending on the context. I will give examples below, but it is important for every individual teacher to think about what components may be necessary within their own context and then on how best to ensure these components are effectively present and used. (There is a much fuller discussion of this in Appendix 1 of my book)</p>
<h3>Learner characteristics</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important of all the components: the learners themselves. Some of the key characteristics are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>what are their goals and motivation to learn what I am teaching them?</li>
<li>in what contexts (home, campus, online) will they prefer to learn?</li>
<li>how diverse are they in terms of language, culture, and prior knowledge?</li>
<li>how digitally capable are they?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these characteristics, what are the implications for providing an effective learning environment for these specific learners?</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>what content do students need to cover? What are the goals in covering this content?</li>
<li>what sources of content are necessary? Who should find, evaluate, and apply these sources: me or the students? If the learners, what do I need to provide to enable them to do this?</li>
<li>how should the content be structured? Who should do this structuring: me or the learners? If learners, what do I need to provide to help them?</li>
<li>what is the right balance between breadth and depth of content for the learners in this specific context?</li>
<li>what activities will learners need in order to acquire and manage this content?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>what skills do students need to develop?</li>
<li>what activities will enable learners to develop and apply these skills? (e.g. thinking, doing, discussing)</li>
<li>what is the goal in skill development? Mastery? A minimal level of performance? How will learners know this?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learner support</h3>
<ul>
<li>what counselling and/or mentoring will learners need to succeed?</li>
<li>how will learners get feedback (particularly on skills development)?</li>
<li>how will learners relate to other learners so they are mutually supporting?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>how much time can I devote to each of the components of a learning environment? What&#8217;s the best way to split my time?</li>
<li>what help will I get from other teaching staff, e.g. teaching assistants, librarians? What is the best way to use them?</li>
<li>what facilities will the learners have available (e.g. learning spaces, online resources)?</li>
<li>what technology can the learners use; how should this be managed and organized?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
<li>what types of assessment should be used? (formative, essays, e-portfolios, projects)?</li>
<li>how will these measure the content and skills that learners are expected to master?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are meant mainly as examples. Each teacher needs to develop and think about what components will be necessary in their context and how best to provide those components.</p>
<p>For instance, I did not include culture as a component. In some contexts, cultural change is one of the most important goals of education. Negative examples of this might include the culture of privilege encouraged in private British boarding schools, or the attempt to replace indigenous cultures with a western culture, as practiced in Canada with aboriginal residential schools. More positive cultural components may be to encourage inclusivity or ethical behaviour. Again, each teacher should decide on what components are important for their learners.</p>
<h2>Necessary but not sufficient</h2>
<p>Thinking about and implementing these components may be necessary, but they are not sufficient in themselves to ensure quality teaching and learning. In addition effective teaching still needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>good design</li>
<li>empathy for the learners</li>
<li>teacher competence (e.g. subject knowledge)</li>
<li>imagination to create an effective learning environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The learners must do the learning. We need to make sure that learners are able to work within an environment that helps them do this. In other words, our job as teachers is to create the conditions for success.</p>
<p>There are no right or wrong ways to build an effective learning environment. It needs to fit the context in which students will learn. However, before even beginning to design a course or program, we should be thinking of what this learning environment could look like.</p>
<p>Technology now enables us to build a wide variety of effective learning environments. But technology alone is not enough; it needs to include other components for learner success. This is not to say that self-managing learners cannot build their own effective, personal learning environments, but they need to consider the other components as well as the technology.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What other components would you add to a successful learning environment?</li>
<li>Could you now design a different and hopefully better learning environment for your courses or programs? If so, what would it look like?</li>
<li>Is this a helpful way to approach the design of online learning or indeed any other form of learning?</li>
</ol>

<p>On Wednesday, February 17, the Chang School of Continuing Studies, Ryerson University, Toronto, put on an impressive one day conference, called <a href="http://changschooltalks.ryerson.ca/">ChangSchoolTalks</a>, focused on experiential learning.</p>
<p>The day was organized into the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>opening keynote</li>
<li>main &#8216;stage&#8217; talks, of 10-15 minutes in length</li>
<li>master classes of 45 minutes length</li>
<li>brain dates: one-on-one mentoring on specific topics</li>
<li>exhibition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opening keynote</h2>
<p>Don Tapscott was the opening keynote speaker, who talked about rethinking learning for the networked age. For those who know <a href="http://dontapscott.com/">Tapscott&#8217;s work</a>, he covered familiar ground, claiming that higher education must respond to four key leadership challenges/ strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the technology revolution, in particular the power of networks and distributed knowledge (&#8216;global intelligence&#8217;)</li>
<li>the Net Generation, who are &#8216;wired to think differently&#8217;</li>
<li>the economic revolution, the move from an industrial to a knowledge-based society</li>
<li>the social revolution, including an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>He referred in passing to his forthcoming book, &#8216;<a href="http://dontapscott.com/2015/06/blockchain-revolution-the-brilliant-technology-changing-money-business-and-the-world/">The Blockchain Revolution, How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World</a>&#8216;, but did not really tie it in to the world of higher education during his talk.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t disagree with many of the points he was making about the need for universities to change, I didn&#8217;t really leave with anything that I didn&#8217;t know already, although others may have found it new and refreshing.</p>
<h2>Stage talks</h2>
<p>Stage talks were plenary sessions. For me, this was the best part of the day, in terms of what I learned. There were five excellent speakers who used their limited time (10-15 minutes) expertly:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arlenedickinson.com/">Arlene Dickinson</a>, an entrepreneur famous as one of the dragons on the TV program &#8216;Dragons&#8217; Den&#8217;, who talked about leadership</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jamespaulgee.com/">James Paul Gee</a>, from Arizona State University, who talked about how participants in multiplayer games collaborated and strategized to solve problems within the games. (I would like to have asked if there was evidence of these problem-solving strategies being successfully transferred outside games, into other kinds of learning environment, but I didn&#8217;t get the chance)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/tedrogersschool/bm/programs/entrepreneurship-and-strategy/steven-gedeon.html">Steve Gedeon</a>, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Strategy at Ryerson University, who talked about the pedagogy of entrepreneurship. This talk appealed to me the most, because Gedeon argued somewhat convincingly that the pedagogy of entrepreneurship (e.g. <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> approaches to learning) could be applied to many other disciplines</li>
<li><a href="http://www.educause.edu/members/michelle-weise">Michelle Weise</a>, from the University of Southern New Hampshire, which is one of the fastest growing universities with one of the largest online programs in the USA. She talked about competency-based education. I have mixed feelings myself about competency-based learning, and it was interesting to hear her arguments for it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/02/08/the-future-of-learning-content-and-campus-bookstores/">Marie Bountrogianni</a>, the Dean of the Chang School at Ryerson, was the master of ceremonies, linking all the talks together.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I liked particularly was the wide range of approaches and topics, with each one well delivered and clearly described in a very short time.</p>
<h2>Master Classes</h2>
<p>These were two sets of six to seven parallel 45 minute sessions covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>robot subjugation for beginners (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-ferworn-b808584">Alex Ferworn</a>)</li>
<li>building an effective learning environment (me)</li>
<li>building pathways through online competency-based education (<a href="http://www.educause.edu/members/michelle-weise">Michelle Weise</a>)</li>
<li>handling reputation and shame in the social world (<a href="http://www.boydneil.com/">Boyd Neil</a>)</li>
<li>collaboration and creativity: a challenge in design thinking (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChangSchool/posts/1284282074930753">Michael Carter</a>)</li>
<li>data visualization: what does your business look like? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9Ip6CULRU">Michael Martin</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>As always with parallel sessions, there was always a clash. Because I was giving one, I could go to only one other. However, the list of titles gives some idea of the diversity of ideas and topics covered.</p>
<p>I will say a little bit more about my master class in a separate blog post.</p>
<h2>Brain dates</h2>
<p>Software made available to the ChangSchoolTalks by the company <a href="http://www.e-180.com/">E-180</a> enabled participants to book online a one-on-one face-to-face session with a personal mentor, i.e. with anyone attending the conference who had expertise that you would like to access. This was somewhat restricted by a very full agenda for the day, but turned out nevertheless to be very popular.</p>
<h2>Exhibition</h2>
<p>There was also a small but very interesting set of exhibitors, covering displays of virtual reality, smart materials ,an augmented reality sandbox, a 3D robot labyrinth, 3D printing, and serious gaming.</p>
<h2>Comment</h2>
<p>The ChangSchoolTalks was a particularly effective showcase for the interests and work being done at Ryerson University.</p>
<p>I came away from the day with my head absolutely buzzing. I was subjected to a torrent of fascinating ideas and developments. What I liked particularly was the diversity of topics, not all of which were specifically educational, but which nevertheless are significant for the future of education.</p>
<p>I would have like a little more time for informal networking, more time for questions and discussion with the &#8216;stage&#8217; speakers, but there is a lot to be said for the fire hose theory of learning! I learned so much in such a short time, but really need to follow up on most of the topics.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I did a Contact North webinar on the above topic. This was the last of <a href="http://teachonline.ca/teachingwebinars">five webinars</a> based on my book, <a href="http://contactnorth.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age.</a></p>
<p>In this webinar, I briefly touched on the following topics that are more extensively covered in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/part/10-trends-in-open-education/">Chapter 10</a> of the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>open textbooks</li>
<li>open research and open data</li>
<li>OER and MOOCs</li>
<li>modularization of learning</li>
<li>disaggregation of services</li>
<li>new course designs that exploit open educational resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>My main argument in the webinar is that we are moving to a point where (nearly) all academic and other content will be open, free and easily accessible online. There is no need for subject experts to select and package knowledge for students. Indeed, in a knowledge-based society, we need to teach those skills to students, so that they can continue to learn after graduating. Such a move though radically changes the role of faculty and instructors, and of course demands appropriate changes in course design.</p>
<p>I also raised these two questions throughout the webinar:</p>
<ul>
<li>why are faculty and instructors not making greater use of open resources?</li>
<li>what can be done to improve the quality of open educational resources so that they will be used more?</li>
</ul>
<p>I also ended the webinar by asking participants the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How could you design your courses to make better use of open resources?</li>
<li>What stops universities from collaborating more in the design and use of open educational resources?</li>
<li>How could open education change the way we offer programs?</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: left;">Campbell, G. (2016) <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/1/networked-learning-as-experiential-learning">Networked learning as experiential learning</a> <em>Educause Review</em>, Vol. 51 No. 1, January 11</p>
<p>This is an interesting if somewhat high level discussion by the Vice-Provost for Learning Innovation at Virginia Commonwealth University, USA, of the importance of networked learning as experiential learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the experience of building and participating within a digitally mediated network of discovery and collaboration is an increasingly necessary foundation for all other forms of experiential learning in a digital age. Moreover, the experience of building and participating within a digitally mediated network of discovery is itself a form of experiential learning, indeed a kind of metaexperiential learning that vividly and concretely teaches the experience of networks themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article might be useful for those who feel a need for a pedagogical or philosophical justification for networked learning. However, I have two reservations about Campbell&#8217;s argument which are closely related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campbell appears in one part of the article to be arguing students need some kind of academic training to understand the underlying nature of digital networking, but he is not too clear in the article about what that entails or indeed what that underlying nature is, beyond the purely technical;</li>
<li>second, I struggled to see what the consequences of the argument are for me as a teacher: what should I be doing to ensure that students are using networked learning as experiential learning? Does this happen automatically?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Campbell is arguing that instructors should move away from selecting and packaging information for students, and allow them to build knowledge through digital networks both within and outside the academy. I of course agree with this part of the argument, but the hard part is knowing the best ways to do this so that learners achieve the knowledge and skills they will need.</p>
<p>As with all teaching methods, networked learning and/or experiential learning can be done well or badly. I would like to see (a) a more precise description of what networked learning means to Gardner in terms of practice, and (b) some guidelines or principles to support instructors in using networked learning as a form of experiential learning. This needs to go beyond what we know about collaborative learning in online groups, although even the application of what we know about this would be a big step forward for most instructors.</p>
<p>Without a clear analysis of <em>how</em> digital networking results in learning, and how this differs from non-digital networked learning, networked learning runs the risk of being yet another overworked buzzword that really doesn&#8217;t help a great deal.</p>
<p>Despite my reservations I encourage you to take a look at this article and see if you can make more sense of it than I have, because I believe that this is a very important development/argument that needs further discussion and critical analysis.</p>

<p>You are probably, like me, getting tired of the different predictions for 2016. So I’m not going to do my usual look forward for the year for individual developments in online learning. Instead, I want to raise a fundamental question about which direction online learning should be heading in the future, because the next year could turn out to be very significant in determining the future of online learning.</p>
<p>The key question we face is whether online learning should aim to replace teachers and instructors through automation, or whether technology should be used to empower not only teachers but also learners. Of course, the answer will always be a mix of both, but getting the balance right is critical.</p>
<h2><strong>An old but increasingly important question</strong></h2>
<p>This question, automation or human empowerment, is not new. It was raised by B.F. Skinner (1968) when he developed teaching machines in the early 1960s. He thought teaching machines would eventually replace teachers. On the other hand, Seymour Papert (1980) wanted computing to empower learners, not to teach them directly. In the early 1980s Papert got children to write computer code to improve the way they think and to solve problems. Papert was strongly influenced by Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, and in particular that children constructed rather than absorbed knowledge.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, as personal computers became more common, computer-assisted learning (CAL or CAD) became popular, using computer-marked tests and early forms of adaptive learning. Also in the 1980s the first developments in artificial intelligence were applied, in the form of intelligent math tutoring. Great predictions were made then, as now, about the potential of AI to replace teachers.</p>
<p>Then along came the Internet. Following my first introduction to the Internet in a friend’s basement in Vancouver, I published an article in the first edition of the <em>Journal of Distance Education</em>, entitled ‘Computer-assisted learning or communications: which way for IT in distance education?’ (1986). In this paper I argued that the real value of the Internet and computing was to enable asynchronous interaction and communication between teacher and learners, and between learners themselves, rather than as teaching machines. This push towards a more constructivist approach to the use of computing in education was encapsulated in Mason and Kaye’s book, Mindweave (1989). Linda Harasim has since argued that online collaborative learning is an important theory of learning in its own right (Harasim, 2012).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, David Noble of York University attacked online learning in particular for turning universities into ‘Digital Diploma Mills’:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘universities are not only undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher education.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Noble (1998) argued that</p>
<blockquote><p>‘high technology, at these universities, is often used not to ……improve teaching and research, but to replace the visions and voices of less-prestigious faculty with the second-hand and reified product of academic &#8220;superstars&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, contrary to Noble’s warnings, for fifteen years most university online courses followed more the route of interaction and communication between teachers and students than computer-assisted learning or video lectures, and Noble’s arguments were easily dismissed or forgotten.</p>
<p>Then along came lecture capture and with it, in 2011, Massive Open Online Courses (xMOOCs) from Coursera, Udacity and edX, driven by elite, highly selective universities, with their claims of making the best professors in the world available to everyone for free. Noble&#8217;s nightmare suddenly became very real. At the same time, these MOOCs have resulted in much more interest in big data, learning analytics, a revival of adaptive learning, and claims that artificial intelligence will revolutionize education, since automation is essential for managing such massive courses.</p>
<p>Thus we are now seeing a big swing back to the automation of learning, driven by powerful computing developments, Silicon Valley start-up thinking, and a sustained political push from those that want to commercialize education (more on this later). Underlying these developments is a fundamental conflict of philosophies and pedagogies, with automation being driven by an objectivist/behaviourist view of the world, compared with the constructivist approaches of online collaborative learning.</p>
<p>In other words, there are increasingly stark choices to be made about the future of online learning. Indeed, it is almost too late &#8211; I fear the forces of automation are winning &#8211; which is why 2016 will be such a pivotal year in this debate.</p>
<h2><strong>Automation and the commercialization of education</strong></h2>
<p>These developments in technology are being accompanied by a big push in the United States, China, India and other countries towards the commercialization of online learning. In other words, education is being seen increasingly as a commodity that can be bought and sold. This is not through the previous and largely discredited digital diploma mills of the for-profit online universities such as the University of Phoenix that David Noble feared, but rather through the encouragement and support of commercial computer companies moving into the education field, companies such as Coursera, Lynda.com and Udacity.</p>
<p>Audrey Watters and EdSurge both produced lists of EdTech ‘deals’ in 2015 totalling between $1-$2 billion. Yes, that’s right, that’s $1-$2 billion in investment in private ed tech companies in the USA (and China) in one year alone. At the same time, entrepreneurs are struggling to develop sustainable business models for ed tech investment, because with education funded publicly, a ‘true’ market is restricted. Politicians, entrepreneurs and policy makers on the right in the USA increasingly see a move to automation as a way of reducing government expenditure on education, and one means by which to ‘free up the market’.</p>
<p>Another development that threatens the public education model is the move by very rich entrepreneurs such as the Gates, the Hewletts and the Zuckerbergs to move their massive personal wealth into ‘charitable’ foundations or corporations and use this money for their pet ‘educational’ initiatives that also have indirect benefits for their businesses. Ian McGugan (2015) in the Globe and Mail newspaper estimates that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a> is worth potentially $45 billion, and one of its purposes is to promote the personalization of learning (another name hi-jacked by computer scientists; it&#8217;s a more human way of describing adaptive learning). Since one way Facebook makes its money is by selling personal data, forgive my suspicions that the Zuckerberg initiative is a not-so-obvious way of collecting data on future high earners. At the same time, the Chang Zuckerberg initiative enables the Zuckerberg’s to avoid paying tax on their profits from Facebook. Instead then of paying taxes that could be used to support public education, these immensely rich foundations enable a few entrepreneurs to set the agenda for how computing will be used in education.</p>
<h2><strong>Why not?</strong></h2>
<p>Technology is disrupting nearly every other business and profession, so why not education? Higher education in particular requires a huge amount of money, mostly raised through taxes and tuition fees, and it is difficult to tie results directly to investment. Surely we should be looking at ways in which technology can change higher education so that it is more accessible, more affordable and more effective in developing the knowledge and skills required in today’s and tomorrow’s society?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It is not so much the need for change that I am challenging, but the means by which this change is being promoted. In essence, a move to automated learning, while saving costs, will not improve the learning that matters, and particularly the outcomes needed in a digital age, namely, the high level intellectual skills of critical thinking, innovation, entrepreneurship, problem-solving , high-level multimedia communication, and above all, effective knowledge management.</p>
<p>To understand why automated approaches to learning are inappropriate to the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century we need to look particularly at the tools and methods being proposed.</p>
<h2><strong>The problems with automating learning</strong></h2>
<p>The main challenge for computer-directed learning such as information transmission and management through Internet-distributed video lectures, computer-marked assessments, adaptive learning, learning analytics, and artificial intelligence is that they are based on a model of learning that has limited applications. Behaviourism works well in assisting rote memory and basic levels of comprehension, but does not enable or facilitate deep learning, critical thinking and the other skills that are essential for learners in a digital age.</p>
<p>R. and D. Susskind (2015) in particular argue that there is a new age in artificial intelligence and adaptive learning driven primarily by what they call the brute force of more powerful computing. Why AI failed so dramatically in the 1980s, they argue, was because computer scientists tried to mimic the way that humans think, and computers then did not have the capacity to handle information in the way they do now. When however we use the power of today&#8217;s computing, it can solve previously intractable problems through analysis of massive amounts of data in ways that humans had not considered.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this argument. The first is that the Susskinds are correct in that computers operate differently from humans. Computers are mechanical and work basically on a binary operating system. Humans are biological and operate in a far more sophisticated way, capable of language creation as well as language interpretation, and use intuition as well as deductive thinking. Emotion as well as memory drives human behaviour, including learning. Furthermore humans are social animals, and depend heavily on social contact with other humans for learning. In essence humans learn differently from the way machine automation operates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computer scientists frequently ignore or are unaware of the research into human learning. In particular they are unaware that learning is largely developmental and constructed, and instead impose an old and less appropriate method of teaching based on behaviourism and an objectivist epistemology. If though we want to develop the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, we need a more constructivist approach to learning.</p>
<p>Supporters of automation also make another mistake in over-estimating or misunderstanding how AI and learning analytics operate in education. These tools reflect a highly objectivist approach to teaching, where procedures can be analysed and systematised in advance. However, although we know a great deal about learning in general, we still know very little about how thinking and decision-making operate biologically in individual cases. At the same time, although brain research is promising to unlock some of these secrets, most brain scientists argue that while we are beginning to understand the relationship between brain activity and very specific forms of behaviour, there is a huge distance to travel before we can explain how these mechanisms affect learning in general or how an individual learns in particular. There are too many variables (such as emotion, memory, perception, communication, as well as neural activity) at play to find an isomorphic fit between the firing of neurons and computer &#8216;intelligence&#8217;.</p>
<p>The danger then with automation is that we drive humans to learn in ways that best suit how machines operate, and thus deny humans the potential of developing the higher levels of thinking that make humans different from machines. For instance, humans are better than machines at dealing with volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous situations, which is where we find ourselves in today’s society.</p>
<p>Lastly, both AI and adaptive learning depend on algorithms that predict or direct human behaviour. These algorithms though are not transparent to the end users. To give an example, learning analytics are being used to identify students at high risk of failure, based on correlations of previous behaviour online by previous students. However, for an individual, should a software program be making the decision as to whether that person is suitable for higher education or a particular course? If so, should that person know the grounds on which they are considered unsuitable and be able to challenge the algorithm or at least the principles on which that algorithm is based? Who makes the decision about these algorithms – a computer scientist using correlated data, or an educator concerned with equitable access? The more we try to automate learning, the greater the danger of unintended consequences, and the more need for educators rather than computer scientists to control the decision-making.</p>
<h2><strong>The way forward</strong></h2>
<p>In the past, I used to think of computer scientists as colleagues and friends in designing and delivering online learning. I am now increasingly seeing at least some of them as the enemy. This is largely to do with the hubris of Silicon Valley, which believes that computer scientists can solve any problem without knowing anything about the problem itself. MOOCs based on recorded lectures are a perfect example of this, being developed primarily by a few computer scientists from Stanford (and unfortunately blindly copied by many people in universities who should have known better.)</p>
<p>We need to start with the problem, which is how do we prepare learners for the knowledge and skills they will need in today’s society. I have argued (Bates, 2015) that we need to develop, in very large numbers of people, high level intellectual and practical skills that require the construction and development of knowledge, and that enable learners to find, analyse, evaluate and apply knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>This requires a constructivist approach to learning which cannot be appropriately automated, as it depends on high quality interaction between knowledge experts and learners. There are many ways to accomplish this, and technology can play a leading role, by enabling easy access to knowledge, providing opportunities for practice in experientially-based learning environments, linking communities of scholars and learners together, providing open access to unlimited learning resources, and above all by enabling students to use technology to access, organise and demonstrate their knowledge appropriately.</p>
<p>These activities and approaches do not easily lend themselves to massive economies of scale through automation, although they do enable more effective outcomes and possibly some smaller economies of scale. Automation can be helpful in developing some of the foundations of learning, such as basic comprehension or language acquisition. But at the heart of developing the knowledge and skills needed in today’s society, the role of a human teacher, instructor or guide will remain absolutely essential. Certainly, the roles of teachers and instructors will need to change quite dramatically, teacher training and faculty development will be critical for success, and we need to use technology to enable students to take more responsibility for their own learning, but it is a dangerous illusion to believe that automation is the solution to learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<h2><strong>Protecting the future</strong></h2>
<p>There are several practical steps that need to be taken to prevent the automation of teaching.</p>
<ol>
<li>Educators – and in particular university presidents and senior civil servants with responsibility for education – need to speak out clearly about the dangers of automation, and the technology alternatives available that still exploit its potential and will lead to greater cost-effectiveness. This is not an argument against the use of technology in education, but the need to use it wisely so we get the kind of educated population we need in the 21st century.</li>
<li>Computer scientists need to show more respect to educators and be less arrogant. This means working collaboratively with educators, and treating them as equals.</li>
<li>We – teachers and educational technologists – need to apply in our own work and disseminate better to those outside education what we already know about effective learning and teaching.</li>
<li>Faculty and teachers need to develop compelling technology alternatives to automation that focus on the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age, such as:
<ul>
<li>experiential learning through virtual reality (e.g. Loyalist College&#8217;s training of border service agents)</li>
<li>networking learners online with working professionals, to solve real world problems (e.g. by developing a program similar to McMaster&#8217;s integrated science program for online/blended delivery)</li>
<li>building strong communities of practice through connectivist MOOCs (e.g. on climate change or mental health) to solve global problems</li>
<li>empowering students to use social media to research and demonstrate their knowledge through multimedia e-portfolios (e.g. UBC&#8217;s ETEC 522)</li>
<li>designing openly accessible high quality, student-activated simulations and games but designed and monitored by experts in the subject area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governments need to put as much money into research into learning and educational technology as they do into innovation in industry. Without better and more defensible theories of learning suitable for a digital age, we are open to any quack or opportunist who believes he or she has the best snake oil. More importantly, with better theory and knowledge of learning disseminated and applied appropriately, we can have a much more competitive workforce and a more just society.</li>
<li>We need to educate our politicians about the dangers of commercialization in education through the automation of learning and fight for a more equal society where the financial returns on technology applications are more equally shared.</li>
<li>Become <a href="http://www.utne.com/politics/meet-the-edupunks-radical-self-education.aspx">edupunks</a> and take back the web from powerful commercial interests by using open source, low cost, easy to use tools in education that protect our privacy and enable learners and teachers to control how they are used.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should keep you busy in 2016.</p>
