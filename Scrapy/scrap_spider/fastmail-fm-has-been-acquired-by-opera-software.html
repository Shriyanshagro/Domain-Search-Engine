<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2010/04/30/fastmail-fm-has-been-acquired-by-opera-software/'>FastMail.FM has been acquired by Opera Software</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 30 April 2010</p>
<p>Some exciting changes will be occurring with FastMail.FM. FastMail.FM
has been acquired by Opera Software, the developers of the Opera web
browser. For more information about Opera, please visit
<a href="http://www.opera.com">www.opera.com</a>.</p>

<p>This is great news for FastMail.FM users. FastMail.FM will continue to
run and grow as the reliable email service you've known for over 10
years. We'll be combining forces with Opera's technical teams, expertise
and products to develop new and innovative products.</p>

<p>Below we've put together an FAQ of some questions we thought customers
might have.</p>

<p>The FastMail Team</p>

<hr />

<h2>Opera purchase of FastMail FAQ</h2>

<p>If you've found this page, it's probably because you didn't understand
everything in the email our lawyers made us send out :)</p>

<h2>What do I have to do?</h2>

<p>In the email we sent you, there was a link to a web page. Click the link
to go to that page, and on that page, click the "I Accept" button.
Alternatively, do nothing, and just continue to use your account as you
normally do. Both of these actions indicate that you accept that Opera
take over the operation of your account and personal data.</p>

<p>There are no configuration changes or any other changes you need to
make. Opera will take over the running of FastMail.FM including all
existing accounts, so things will just run as they do now with the same
billing cycle, pricing, features, reliability, security, etc. Relax,
everything is going to continue just fine.</p>

<p><strong>What if I don't click the "I Accept" button?</strong></p>

<p>If you continue to use your account, we will treat this in the same way
as if you had clicked the "I Accept" button.</p>

<p><strong>What if I don't want Opera to take over my account?</strong></p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/">http://www.fastmail.fm</a>, login to your
account, then go to the Options -> Cancel Account screen and enter your
password to confirm you want to cancel your account.</p>

<p><strong>What is this "personal data" that Opera are taking over?</strong></p>

<p>Your mailbox and your account registration details, which they will
treat under the same terms of service and privacy policy as we have been
doing. Our <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_terms.html">terms of
service</a> and our
<a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2>What's this mean for the future?</h2>

<p>This is great news for FastMail.FM users. FastMail.FM will continue to
run and grow as the reliable email service you've known for over 10
years. Opera have clear plans for the future, and can help provide
significantly more resources to build a bigger and better infrastructure
and more features.</p>

<h2>Why are FastMail selling?</h2>

<p>In an increasingly competitive market, we believe we need to make some
big investments to take the next steps forward. Joining together Opera's
expertise in web browsers and especially the mobile market, and
FastMail.FM's expertise in email, will allow us to grow and take on the
next big challenges in running and building an email service.</p>

<p>Opera have a huge browser customer base (<a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2010/04/12/">over 100 million
users</a>), and a thriving
community of users at <a href="http://my.opera.com/">my.opera.com</a>, which will
help us grow FastMail in size and reach.</p>

<p>The FastMail.FM staff are also excited about this change. We've already
been working with Opera's technical teams to exchange expertise, and to
develop new and innovative products. Some FastMail.FM staff are already
gearing up to move to Norway (Hei!), and vice-versa. Also one of our
great long-term part time developers (Neil Jenkins), who helped develop
the photo gallery feature, and the new webmail interface (all the HTML,
CSS and JS), is going to work for Opera full-time as well, so he'll be
available to work with the email team to build an even better interface!</p>

<p>With Opera’s expertise, and the combined technical talent of our staff,
we believe we’ll be able to create a significantly better FastMail for
customers in the future.</p>
