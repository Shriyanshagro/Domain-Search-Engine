        <strong>NIST Released Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems</strong><br />
        May 4, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        NIST announces the release of <a href="../publications/drafts/800-160/sp800_160_second-draft.pdf"><strong>second draft Special Publication 800-160</strong></a>, <em>Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems</em>. </p>
        <p class="top">NIST Public Affairs Office published a <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/building-security-into-cyber-physical-systems-nist-researchers-suggest-approach-for-trustworthy-modern-infrastructure.cfm"><strong>press release</strong></a> of this draft (SP 800-160).<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The United States has developed incredibly powerful and complex systems—systems that are inexorably linked to the economic and national security interests of the Nation. The complete dependence on those systems for mission and business success in both the public and private sectors, including the critical infrastructure, has left the Nation extremely vulnerable to hostile cyber-attacks and other serious threats. With the continuing frequency, intensity, and adverse consequences of cyber-attacks, disruptions, hazards, and threats to federal, state, and local governments, the military, businesses, industry, and the critical infrastructure, the need for trustworthy secure systems has never been more important.
          <br />&nbsp;<br />
          Engineering-based approaches to solutions are essential to managing the growing complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness of today’s systems—as exemplified by cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems, including the Internet of Things. Managing the complexity of today’s systems and being able to claim that those systems are trustworthy and secure means that first and foremost, there must be a level of confidence in the feasibility and correctness-in-concept, philosophy, and design, regarding the ability of a system to function securely as intended. Failure to address the complexity issue in this manner will continue to leave the Nation susceptible to the consequences of an increasingly pervasive set of disruptions, hazards, and threats with potential for causing serious, severe, or even catastrophic consequences.
          <br />&nbsp;<br />
          NIST Special Publication 800-160 attempts to bring greater clarity to the difficult and challenging problems associated with a systems-oriented viewpoint on realizing trustworthy secure systems—and does so through the considerations set forth in a set of standards-based systems engineering processes applied throughout the life cycle.

        <strong>NIST Released NISTIR 8105, Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong> <br />
        April 28, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        NIST is pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8105.pdf"><strong>NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8105</strong></a>, <em>Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography</em>.   NIST Public Affairs Office <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/nist-kicks-off-effort-to-defend-encrypted-data-from-quantum-computer-threat.cfm"><strong>issued a press release</strong></a> in regards to announcing the release of this NISTIR.</p>
        <p class="top">This Report shares NIST’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space.  The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.
          <br />&nbsp;<br />
          The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.    In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers.  If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere.

        <strong>NIST Released NISTIR 8040, Measuring the Usability and Security of Permuted Passwords on Mobile Platforms</strong> <br />
        April 27, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        NIST has published <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8040.pdf"><strong>NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8040</strong></a>, <em>Measuring the Usability and Security of Permuted Passwords on Mobile Platform</em>s. Password entry on mobile devices significantly impacts both usability and security, but there is a lack of usable security research in this area, specifically for complex password entry. This document proposes a measurement method for quantifying the effects on security resulting from optimizing the usability of password entry specifically for constrained input environments, i.e., the mobile touchscreen. A set of Python scripts for the experiments the NIST/ITL research team conducted on entropy loss are made publicly available.        </p>

        <strong>NIST Released Special Publication 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption</strong> <br />
        March 29, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        NIST is pleased to announce the  release of <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-38G.pdf"><strong>Special Publication 800-38G</strong></a>, <em>Recommendation  for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption. </em>This  publication specifies and approves the FF1 and FF3 encryption modes of  operation of the AES algorithm.
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
        The  previously approved encryption modes are not designed for non-binary data such  as Social Security numbers (SSNs); in particular, the decimal representation of  an encrypted SSN might consist of more than nine digits, so it would not look  like an SSN. 
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
        By contrast,  format-preserving encryption (FPE) methods such as FF1 and FF3 are designed for  data that is not necessarily binary. In particular, given any finite set of  symbols, like the decimal numerals, a method for FPE transforms data that is  formatted as a sequence of the symbols in such a way that the encrypted form of  the data has the same format, including the length, as the original data. Thus,  an FPE-encrypted SSN would be a sequence of nine decimal digits.</p>
        <p>FPE modes facilitate  the retrofitting of encryption technology to existing devices or software,  where a conventional encryption mode might not be feasible. In particular,  database applications may not support changes to the length or format of data  fields. 
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
        More  generally, FPE can support the &ldquo;sanitization&rdquo; of databases, i.e., the targeting  of encryption to personally identifiable information (PII), such as SSNs.&nbsp; The encrypted SSNs could still serve as an  index to facilitate statistical research, perhaps across multiple databases. An  important caveat to this application of FPE is that re-identification is  sometimes feasible through the analysis of the unencrypted data and other  information.
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
          The  commercial impetus comes from the payments industry, where FPE methods have  already been deployed in merchants&rsquo; credit card readers. NIST is also  considering for approval a third mode from that industry, the  extension/revision of the VAES3 mode, which was named FF2 in the draft SP  800-38G that was released for public comment. This revision of FF2 is listed by  the name &ldquo;DFF&rdquo; at the modes development page, at <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html</a>. </p>
NIST received patent disclosures that are claimed to  apply to FPE modes. Letters of Assurance to NIST regarding the licensing of  these patents are available at <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/current_modes.html">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/current_modes.html</a>.

        <strong>NIST Announce the Release of DRAFT NISTIR 8105, Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography for Public Comment</strong> <br />
        February 3, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        NIST requests public comments on <strong>DRAFT NISTIR 8105</strong>, <em>Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography</em>.  In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere.  The goal of <em>post-quantum cryptography</em> (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.  This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space.  The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.

        The National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is pleased to announce the initial  public draft release of <strong>NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) 8011</strong>, <em>Automation  Support for Security Control Assessments</em>, Volumes 1 and 2. This NISTIR  represents a joint effort between NIST and the Department of Homeland Security  to provide an operational approach for automating security control assessments in order to facilitate information security continuous  monitoring (ISCM), ongoing assessment, and ongoing security authorizations in a  way that is consistent with  the NIST Risk Management Framework overall and the guidance in NIST SPs 800-53  and 800-53A in particular. &nbsp;
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
        NISTIR 8011 will  ultimately consist of 13 volumes. Volume 1 introduces the general approach to  automating security control assessments, 12 ISCM security capabilities, and  terms and concepts common to all 12 capabilities. Volume 2 provides details specific  to the hardware asset management security capability. The remaining 11 ISCM  security capability volumes will provide details specific to each capability  but will be organized in a very similar way to Volume 2.

        <strong>DRAFT SP 800-90 Series: Random Bit Generators <br>
        Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation</strong><br />
        January 27, 2016
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        
        NIST announces the <a href="../publications/drafts/800-90/sp800-90b_second_draft.pdf"><strong>second draft of Special Publication (SP) 800-90B</strong></a>, <em>Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation</em>. This Recommendation specifies the design principles and requirements for the entropy sources used by Random Bit Generators, and the tests for the validation of entropy sources. These entropy sources are intended to be combined with Deterministic Random Bit Generator mechanisms that are specified in SP 800-90A to construct Random Bit Generators, as specified in SP 800-90C. NIST is planning to host a workshop on Random Number Generation to discuss the SP 800-90 series, specifically, SP 800-90B and SP 800-90C. More information about the workshop is available at: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/rbg_workshop2016.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/rbg_workshop2016.cfm</a>. 
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        
        The specific areas where comments are solicited on SP 800-90B are:
        
        <ul class="bullets1">
           <li>	<em>Post-processing functions (Section 3.2.2)</em>: We provided a list of approved post-processing functions. Is the selection of the functions appropriate?</li>
           <li> <em>Entropy assessment (Section 3.1.5)</em>: While estimating the entropy for entropy sources using a conditioning component, the values of n and q are multiplied by the constant 0.85. Is the selection of this constant reasonable?</li>
           <li> <em>Multiple noise sources</em>: The Recommendation only allows using multiple noise sources if the noise sources are independent. Should the use of dependent noise sources also be allowed, and if so, how can we calculate an entropy assessment in this case?</li>
           <li> <em>Health Tests</em>: What actions should be taken when health tests raise an alarm? The minimum allowed value of a type I error for health testing is selected as 2-50. Is this selection reasonable?</li>
           </ul>
