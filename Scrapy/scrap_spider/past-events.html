			<description><![CDATA[<p>The impact of climate change on agriculture brings into stark focus the issue of food security in the context of a growing world population. At the global climate change summit in Paris (<a href="http://www.cta.int/en/news/cop21.html" target="_blank">COP21</a>), a CTA co-organised event focused on some of the issues related to climate change, agriculture and food security. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>At a side event held at the Paris climate change talks, COP21, some concrete examples illustrated what can be achieved when individuals and organisations combat the effects of changing climate patterns and extreme weather events through innovative solutions. Another important side event held two days later, highlighted how countries are leading the way by including action on agriculture in their Intended Nationally Determined Commitments (INDCs). These are commitments that governments were asked to make in the run-up to this month’s crucial COP21 meeting in the French capital.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Report from COP21: Climate-smart agriculture showcased at Paris climate talks</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many countries engaged in the Paris climate negotiations have included agriculture in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), giving more prominence to the sector. However, agriculture is not yet a substantial issue for negotiators. At a CTA co-organised event at the global climate conference in Paris, three experts share innovative approaches to climate-smart agriculture in Africa.  </p>]]></description>

			<title>Live from COP21:  Spotlight on agriculture at the Paris climate talks</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a contributor to climate change, but also as part of the solution, agriculture is central to any debate on global warming. However, a detailed treatment of agriculture has yet to enter  the negotiations underway at the Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Paris climate change talks currently under way are unlikely to reach an explicit deal on agriculture. But an important  side event has highlighted how countries are leading the way by including action on agriculture in their Intended Nationally Determined Commitments (INDCs). These are commitments that governments were asked to make in the run-up to this month’s crucial COP21 meeting in the French capital.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Live from COP21:  Making agriculture 'smart' to combat Climate Change</title>
			<link>http://www.cta.int/en/article/2015-12-04/live-from-cop21-making-agriculture-smart-to-combat-climate-change.html</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A side event organised today at the Paris climate summit showcases practical solutions for combating the effects of changing climate patterns and extreme weather events, which affect the productivity, costs and competitiveness of farming. Climate-smart agriculture has strong potential to help farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change. But although small-scale producers in some countries are already reaping the benefits, there is an urgent need to spread information and scale up proven practices to other users and areas.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the Paris Climate Conference (COP21), a new animated video provides policy-makers with a preview of the Pacific’s future under a changing climate. The scenarios depicted in the video were created by a team of policy-makers, researchers, farmers, and political leaders from the region, who spent three days creating <a href="http://www.cta.int/en/article/2015-09-03/visions-of-the-future-building-climate-resilience-amongst-pacific-region-fishers-and-farmers.html" target="_blank">four future scenarios for the Pacific region up to 2030</a>. This workshop was convened by CTA, the <a href="http://www.spc.int/en/about-spc/structure.html">Secretariat of the Pacific Community</a>, <a href="http://www.worldfishcenter.org/">WorldFish</a> and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (<a href="https://ccafs.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">CCAFS</a>).</p>]]></description>
