<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2009/11/06/western-digital-re4-gp-2tb-drive-problems-and-solutions/'>Western Digital RE4-GP 2TB drive problems and solutions</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  6 November 2009</p>
<p>We recently upgraded the drives in a few of our servers to new <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=610">WD
RE4-GP 2TB</a>
drives. Initially these drives worked really well, but after a little
time, we noticed that the RAID controller they were connected to (an
<a href="http://www.areca.com.tw/products/main.htm">ARECA</a> based controller) was
reporting a significantly higher number of "read timeout" errors for
these drives (a few per day, rather than "every now and then" as for all
other drives).</p>

<p>Looking around, we found <a href="http://blog.insanegenius.com/2009/09/western-digital-re4-gp-2tb-drive.html">other
reports</a>
of problems with these drives and RAID controllers, although ours
weren't as serious as the other reports, drives weren't "dropping" out
of our arrays, just more read timeouts. In one of the <a href="http://blog.insanegenius.com/2009/09/western-digital-re4-gp-2tb-drive.html?showComment=1255551170684#c6798270576134643027">comments posted
on that
blog</a>,
a user notes there's an upgraded firmware for the WD drives that helped
him.</p>

<p>Searching around, I also found out about the firmware update in the
<a href="http://3ware.com/KB/article.aspx?id=15592">knowledge base on the 3ware
site</a>, from 04.05G04 to
04.05G05. It seems they are also recommending it for compatibility with
their RAID controllers, and include a copy of the new firmware there
(with all the usual disclaimers of course). Unfortunately the process to
upgrade the firmware requires attaching the drive directly to a
motherboard SATA controller and running a DOS only utility. To do that
for the 24 drives would be a slow and annoying process.</p>

<p>Fortunately it turns out that modern SATA drives now have a standard
process for upgrading the firmware, so it's actually possible for this
to be done via the RAID controller rather than requiring a custom
upgrade program. With some help from our vendor (thanks Hao Zhang at e23
Inc) and ARECA, they were able to build the new firmware file into a
format suitable for upload to their RAID controllers. So we did that,
rebooted the unit, and a few minutes later, all the drives in the unit
had been upgraded to the newer 04.05G05 firmware. Nice and quick and
easy. (Sorry, we can't distribute this file, so please don't ask us.
Contact your vendor to get it if you need it)</p>

<p>Since then, there's been no read timeout errors reported by any of the
drives, and they've continued to work really well.</p>

<p>So if you're using the WD RE4-GP 2TB drives and having problems, make
sure you upgrade them to the latest firmware version.</p>
