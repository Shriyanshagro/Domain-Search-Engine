</a> W3C published today the complete definition of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-html5-20121217/">HTML5</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-2dcontext-20121217/">Canvas 2D</a> specifications. Though not yet W3C standards, these specifications are now feature complete, meaning businesses and developers have a stable target for implementation and planning. "As of today, businesses know what they can rely on for HTML5 in the coming years, and what their customers will demand," said Jeff Jaffe, W3C CEO. HTML5 is the cornerstone of the <a href="/standards/">Open Web Platform</a>, a full programming environment for cross-platform applications with access to device capabilities; video and animations; graphics; style, typography, and other tools for digital publishing; extensive network capabilities; and more. Read the <strong><a href="/2012/12/html5-cr">full press release and W3C Member testimonials</a></strong>.</p>

<p>To reduce browser fragmentation and extend implementations to the full range of tools that consume and produce HTML, W3C now embarks on the stage of W3C standardization devoted to interoperability and testing.
W3C is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html">on schedule</a> to finalize the
HTML5 standard in 2014. In parallel, the W3C community will continue its work on next generation HTML features, including extensions to complement built-in HTML5 accessibility, responsive images, and adaptive streaming.</p>

<p>The HTML Working Group also published first drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html51-20121217/">HTML 5.1</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-2dcontext2-20121217/">HTML Canvas 2D Context, Level 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html-main-element-20121217/">main element</a>, providing an early view of the next round of standardization.

Selectors, which are widely used in CSS, are patterns that match against elements in a tree structure. The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving Element nodes from the DOM by matching against a group of selectors. It is often desirable to perform DOM operations on a specific set of elements in a document. These methods simplify the process of acquiring specific elements, especially compared with the more verbose techniques defined and used in the past. Comments are welcome through 25 January.

<ul class="show_items">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-webaudio-20121213/">Web Audio API</a>. This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/">Audio Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-webmidi-20121213/">Web MIDI API</a>. This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems. At the same time, the Web MIDI API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically.</li></ul>

<p>This workshop provided a way for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/08/web-and-automotive/participants.html">participants</a> to focus on opportunities and challenges for exploiting Web technologies within the car, and what kinds of standards work may be needed to realize the potential. The Workshop participants reached a broad consensus that HTML5 is a compelling basis for automotive, and that it is now timely to launch standardization of user centric vehicle APIs in order to avoid the risk of fragmentation from competing approaches. Other aspects were identified, such as safety, network and devices integration, business and advertising.</p> 
<p>The Workshop prioritized work on use cases and requirements, security/policy mechanisms, a user centric vehicle API and a reference model. The next steps are likely to include further outreach with the aim of launching a standards activity; W3C staff will work with stakeholders to identify opportunities for launching work in support of standards for Web and Automotive.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/">Provenance Working Group</a> has published four Candidate Recommendation Documents along with corresponding supporting notes. You can find a complete list at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-prov-overview-20121211/">PROV Overview draft</a>. These document provide a framework for interchanging provenance on the Web. PROV enables one to represent and interchange provenance information using widely available formats such as RDF and XML. In addition, it provides definitions for accessing provenance information, validating it, and mapping to Dublin Core.</p>
<p>The release of these Candidate Recommendation documents is a signal to developers that the Working Group believes that each specification is ready for implementation. Although there are already a number of implementations around, the Provenance Working Group kindly asks for developers across the Web to implement the specification and provide implementation feedback. </p>
<p>You can contact the group directly through the <a href="mailto:public-prov-comments@w3.org">public comments mailing list</a>. You are also encouraged to fill out one of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/ProvImplementations">group's surveys</a> about your usage of PROV.</p>

This specification standardizes a packaging format and metadata for a class of software known commonly as packaged apps or widgets. Unlike traditional user interface widgets (e.g., buttons, input boxes, toolbars, etc.), widgets as specified in this document are full-fledged client-side applications that are authored using technologies such as HTML and then packaged for distribution. Examples range from simple clocks, stock tickers, news casters, games and weather forecasters, to complex applications that pull data from multiple sources to be "mashed-up" and presented to a user in some interesting and useful way.

CSS Masking provides two means for partially or fully hiding portions of visual elements: masking and clipping. Masking describes how to use another graphical element or image as a luminance or alpha mask. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer and then that buffer is composited into the element's parent. Luminance and alpha masks influence the transparency of this buffer before the compositing stage.  Clipping describes the visible region of visual elements. The region can be described by using certain SVG graphics elements or basic shapes. Anything outside of this region is not rendered.</p>

  <p class="date"><span class="dtstart published" title="2012-11-09T18:11:29-05:00">09 November 2012</span></p>
  <p>W3C announced today the launch of the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Working 
Group</a>. Web browsers can receive input in a variety of ways. A “pointer” is an abstract form of input that can be any point of contact on a input surface made by a mouse cursor, pen, finger, or multiple fingers. The mission of this group is to define a single unified event model for mouse, touch, and pen/tablet user interfaces. Enabling content creators to use a single model for different input types will make content creation more efficient and inclusive. See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/charter/">Pointer Events 
Working Group Charter</a> for more information.</p>

  Eleven SPARQL 1.1 Specifications Published
 </a>
  
  </h3>
  <p class="date"><span class="dtstart published" title="2012-11-08T14:28:25-05:00">08 November 2012</span></p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql">SPARQL Working Group</a> has today published a set of eleven documents, advancing most of SPARQL 1.1 to Proposed Recommendation.  Building on the success of SPARQL 1.0, SPARQL 1.1 is a full-featured standard system for working with RDF data, including a query/update language, two HTTP protocols (one full-featured, one using basic HTTP verbs), three result formats, and other features which allow SPARQL endpoints to be combined and work together.  Most features of SPARQL 1.1 have already been implemented by a range of SPARQL suppliers, as shown in our <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/implementations/">table of implementations and test results</a>.</p>

<p>The Proposed Recommendations are:</p>

<ol class="show_items">

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL 1.1 Overview</a> - Overview of SPARQL
    1.1 and the SPARQL 1.1 documents</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL 1.1 Query Language</a> - A query language
    for RDF data.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/">SPARQL 1.1 Update</a> - Specifies additions to the query language to allow clients to update stored data</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/">SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format</a> - How to use JSON for SPARQL query results</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/">SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats</a> - How to use comma-separated values (CVS) and tab-separated values (TSV) for SPARQL query results</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-rdf-sparql-XMLres-20121108/">SPARQL Query Results XML Format</a> - How to use XML for SPARQL query results.  (This contains only minor, editorial updates from SPARQL 1.0, and is actually a Proposed Edited Recommendation.)</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/">SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query</a> - an extension of the SPARQL 1.1 Query Language for
    executing queries distributed over different SPARQL
    endpoints.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/">SPARQL 1.1 Service Description</a> - a method for discovering and a vocabulary for
    describing SPARQL services.</li>

  </ol>

<p>The following are Candidate Recommendations, as the group still seeks more feedback from implementors:</p>

  <ol class="show_items">

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-entailment/">SPARQL 1.1 Entailment Regimes</a> - defines the semantics of SPARQL queries under entailment
    regimes such as RDF Schema, OWL, or RIF.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/">SPARQL 1.1 Protocol for RDF</a> - A protocol
    defining means for conveying arbitrary SPARQL queries and
    update requests to a SPARQL service.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/">SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol</a> - As
    opposed to the full SPARQL protocol, this specification defines
    minimal means for managing RDF graph content directly via
    common HTTP operations.</li>

  </ol>



<p>The group has also produced a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/">test suite</a> and a page on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/using-with-rdf11">using SPARQL 1.1 with RDF 1.1</a>.

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-grid-layout-20121106/">CSS Grid Layout</a>. Grid Layout contains features targeted at web application authors. The Grid can be used to achieve many different layouts. It excels at dividing up space for major regions of an application, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, the Grid enables an author to align elements into columns and rows, but unlike tables, the Grid doesn't have content structure, and thus enables a wide variety of layouts not possible with tables. In addition, the absence of content structure in the Grid helps to manage changes to layout by using fluid and source order independent layout techniques. By combining media queries with the CSS properties that control layout of the Grid and its children, authors can adapt their layout to changes in device form factors, orientation, and available space, without needing to alter the semantic nature of their content.

Filter effects are a way of processing an element's rendering before it is displayed in the document. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer (such as a raster image) and then that buffer is composited into the elements parent. Filters apply an effect before the compositing stage. Examples of such effects are blurring, changing color intensity and warping the image.

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data Working Group</a> has published a Last Call Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-org-20121023/">An organization ontology</a>. This document describes a core ontology for organizational structures, aimed at supporting linked data publishing of organizational information across a number of domains. It is designed to allow domain-specific extensions to add classification of organizations and roles, as well as extensions to support neighbouring information such as organizational activities.  Comments are welcome through 25 November. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/eGov/">eGovernment Activity</a>.</p>

  Call for Review: OWL 2

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/">OWL Working Group</a> has published twelve Proposed Edited Recommendations today, and two Working Group Notes:</p>
<p>The OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with formally defined meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. Comments on the Proposed Edited Recommendations are welcome through 15 November.</p>
<ul class="show_items">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-overview-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Document Overview</a>. This document serves as an introduction to OWL 2 and the various other OWL 2 documents. It describes the syntaxes for OWL 2, the different kinds of semantics, the available profiles (sub-languages), and the relationship between OWL 1 and OWL 2.</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-syntax-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Structural Specification and Functional-Style Syntax</a>. The meaningful constructs provided by OWL 2 are defined in terms of their structure. As well, a functional-style syntax is defined for these constructs, with examples and informal descriptions. One can reason with OWL 2 ontologies under either the RDF-Based Semantics  or the Direct Semantics. If certain restrictions on OWL 2 ontologies are satisfied and the ontology is in OWL 2 DL, reasoning under the Direct Semantics can be implemented using techniques well known in the literature.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-mapping-to-rdf-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Mapping to RDF Graphs</a>.This document defines the mapping of OWL 2 ontologies into RDF graphs, and vice versa.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-direct-semantics-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Direct Semantics</a>. This document provides the direct model-theoretic semantics for OWL 2, which is compatible with the description logic SROIQ. Furthermore, this document defines the most common inference problems for OWL 2.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-rdf-based-semantics-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language RDF-Based Semantics</a>. This document defines the RDF-compatible model-theoretic semantics of OWL 2.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-conformance-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Conformance</a>. This document describes the conditions that OWL 2 tools must satisfy in order to be conformant with the language specification. It also presents a common format for OWL 2 test cases that both illustrate the features of the language and can be used for testing conformance.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-profiles-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Profiles</a>. This document provides a specification of several profiles of OWL 2 which can be more simply and/or efficiently implemented. In logic, profiles are often called fragments. Most profiles are defined by placing restrictions on the structure of OWL 2 ontologies. These restrictions have been specified by modifying the productions of the functional-style syntax.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-new-features-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language New Features and Rationale</a>.This document is a simple introduction to the new features of the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, including an explanation of the differences between the initial version of OWL and OWL 2. The document also presents the requirements that have motivated the design of the main new features, and their rationale from a theoretical and implementation perspective.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-quick-reference-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Quick Reference Guide</a>. This document provides a non-normative quick reference guide to the OWL 2 language. It also provides links to other documents, including the OWL 2 Primer for language introduction and examples, the OWL 2 Structural Specification and Functional Syntax document for more details of the functional syntax, and the OWL 2 New Features and Rationale document for new feature descriptions.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-xml-serialization-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language XML Serialization</a>. This document specifies an XML serialization for OWL 2 that mirrors its structural specification. An XML schema defines this syntax and is available as a separate document, as well as being included here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-rdf-plain-literal-20121018/">rdf:PlainLiteral: A Datatype for RDF Plain Literals</a>. This document presents the specification of a primitive datatype for the plain literals of RDF.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PER-owl2-primer-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Primer</a>. This primer provides an approachable introduction to OWL 2, including orientation for those coming from other disciplines, a running example showing how OWL 2 can be used to represent first simple information and then more complex information, how OWL 2 manages ontologies, and finally the distinctions between the various sublanguages of OWL 2.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-owl2-manchester-syntax-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Manchester Syntax</a>. This Working Group Note of The Manchester syntax is a user-friendly compact syntax for OWL 2 ontologies; it is frame-based, as opposed to the axiom-based other syntaxes for OWL 2. The Manchester Syntax is used in the OWL 2 Primer, and this document provides the language used there. It is expected that tools will extend the Manchester Syntax for their own purposes, and tool builders may collaboratively extend the common language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-owl2-dr-linear-20121018/">OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Data Range Extension: Linear Equations</a>. This Working Group Note specifies a syntax and semantics for incorporating linear equations with rational coefficients solved in the reals in OWL 2.</li>

This document defines a subset of PROV instances called valid PROV instances. The intent of validation is ensure that a PROV instance represents a history of objects and their interactions which is consistent, and thus safe to use for the purpose of logical reasoning and other kinds of analysis. Valid PROV instances satisfy certain definitions, inferences, and constraints. These definitions, inferences, and constraints provide a measure of consistency checking for provenance and reasoning over provenance.

Content or software that is authored in one language (the source language) is often made available in additional languages or adapted with regard to other cultural aspects. This is done through a process called localization, where the original material is translated and adapted to the target audience. In addition, document formats expressed by schemas may be used by people in different parts of the world, and these people may need special markup to support the local language or script. For example, people authoring in languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Urdu need special markup to specify directionality in mixed direction text.</p>

<ul class="show_items">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-fonts-20120823/">CSS Fonts Module Level 3</a>. This CSS3 module describes how font properties are specified and how font resources are loaded dynamically. The contents of this specification are a consolidation of content previously divided into CSS3 Fonts and CSS3 Web Fonts modules.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-regions-20120823/">CSS Regions Module Level 3</a>. The CSS regions module allows content to flow across multiple areas called regions. The regions are not necessarily contiguous in the document order. The CSS regions module provides an advanced content flow mechanism, which can be combined with positioning schemes as defined by other CSS modules such as the Multi-Column Module or the Grid Layout Module to position the regions where content flows.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-selectors4-20120823/">Selectors Level 4</a>. Selectors are patterns that match against elements in a tree, and as such form one of several technologies that can be used to select nodes in an XML document. Selectors have been optimized for use with HTML and XML, and are designed to be usable in performance-critical code. They are a core component of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which uses Selectors to bind style properties to elements in the document.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-break-20120823/">CSS Fragmentation Module Level 3</a>. This module describes the fragmentation model that partitions a flow into pages. It builds on the Page model module and introduces and defines the fragmentation model. It adds functionality for pagination, breaking variable fragment size and orientation, widows and orphans.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PR-r2rml-20120814/">R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language</a>. This document describes R2RML, a language for expressing customized mappings from relational databases to RDF datasets. Such mappings provide the ability to view existing relational data in the RDF data model, expressed in a structure and target vocabulary of the mapping author's choice. R2RML mappings are themselves RDF graphs and written down in Turtle syntax. R2RML enables different types of mapping implementations. Processors could, for example, offer a virtual SPARQL endpoint over the mapped relational data, or generate RDF dumps, or offer a Linked Data interface. Comments are welcome through 15 September. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/PR-rdb-direct-mapping-20120814/">A Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF</a>.

  <p class="date"><span class="dtstart published" title="2012-08-08T08:14:58-05:00">08 August 2012</span></p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">Forms Working Group</a> has published two First Public Working Drafts:</p>
<ul class="show_items"> 
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-xforms20-20120807/">XForms 2.0</a>. XForms is an XML markup for a new generation of forms and form-like applications on the Web, integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML, ODF or SVG. An XForms-based application gathers and processes data using an architecture that separates presentation, purpose and content. XForms accommodates form component reuse, fosters strong data type validation, eliminates unnecessary round-trips to the server, offers device independence and accessibility, and reduces the need for scripting. XForms 2.0 adds support for defining custom functions, variables, a pluggable expression language with extra functions (XPath 2.0), model-based switch and repeat, Attribute Value Templates, consuming and submitting JSON and CSV instance data, amongst other things.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">Forms Working Group</a> has published the First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-xforms-xpath-20120807/">XForms 2.0: XPath expression module</a>. This module defines how XPath could be used for addressing instance data nodes in binding expressions, to express constraints, and to specify calculations in XForms. This module is based on XPath 2.0, but an XPath 1.0 backwards compatibility mode is provided to ensure that nearly all XPath 1.0 expressions continue to deliver the same result with XPath 2.0. This module also defines the XForms Function Library which contains additional functions that are useful for creating forms.</li>

This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (using the responseType and response attributes). For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the canvas 2D and WebGL 3D graphics APIs.

<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-prov-o-20120724/">PROV-O: The PROV Ontology</a> expresses the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2). It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-prov-n-20120724/">PROV-N: The Provenance Notation</a> is introduced to provide examples of the PROV data model: aimed at human consumption, PROV-N allows serializations of PROV instances to be created in a compact manner.

  <p>As part of its ongoing commitment to <a href="/egov/">eGovernment</a> 
and its participation in the EU-funded <a 
href="http://crossover-project.eu/">Crossover Project</a>, W3C ran a 
very successful workshop last month in Brussels titled <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/pmod/">Using Open Data:  policy modeling, citizen empowerment, data 
journalism</a>. Today W3C published the <a href="/2012/06/pmod/report">Workshop report</a>, which summarizes discussions about the interplay between open government data, citizens and policy makers, challenging certain assumptions sometimes made about open  government data.</p>

<p>Several themes emerged from the workshop. For example, social media plays an important route through which governments can access citizen reactions.

  <p>W3C announced today new momentum for making the Web the future interoperable platform for Digital Signage. W3C issued a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/signage/summary.html">summary of key topics and use cases</a> for bringing Digital Signage to the Web, as well as a first gap analysis of enhancements to the Web to enable the transformation of the Digital Signage ecosystem. Digital signage covers a spectrum of display sizes and locations, from sports arenas and urban video terminals of every shape, to monitors in elevators, storefront windows, train stations, and public kiosks featuring rich interactivity. In June, an initial opportunity to discuss next-generation Web-based Digital Signage services drew industry stakeholders to a W3C Workshop "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/signage/cfp.html">All Signs Point to the Web</a>," hosted by NTT. Read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/07/signage.html.en">full press release</a> about the Workshop report and join the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/websignage/">Web-based Signage Business Group</a> to develop use cases and requirements for standardization.</p>

Users of mobile phones, personal computers, tablets or other electronic Devices are increasingly interacting with their devices in a variety of ways: touch screen, voice, stylus, keypads, etc. Today, users, vendors, operators and broadcasters can produce and use all kinds of different Media and Devices that are capable of supporting multiple modes of input or output. Tools for authoring, edition or distribution of Media for Application developers are well-documented. But there is a lack of powerful tools or practices for a richer integration and semantic synchronization of all these media. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized way to build a web Application that can dynamically combine and control discovered modalities by querying a registry based on user-experience data and modality states. This document describes design requirements that the Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces specification needs to cover in order to address this problem.

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> has published a W3C Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619/">Media Queries</a>, which lets designers create effective Web experiences by adjusting styles according to device capabilities (such as screen dimensions or color support) or state (such as device orientation).</p>

<p>W3C also published today a W3C Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-view-mode-20120619/">the 'view-mode' Media Feature</a>, from the
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a>. Mutual dependencies between these two Recommendations caused this publication to be delayed until both could be released simultaneously. The 'view-mode' specification extends media query design capabilities to Web application states (e.g., occupies the entire screen or is minimized).</p>

The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions Comments are welcome through 03 July. </li>
<li>The First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-align-20120612/">CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3</a>. This module contains the features of CSS relating to the alignment of boxes within their containers in the various CSS box layout models: block layout, table layout, flex layout, and grid layout. (The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in CSS3TEXT and CSS3LINEBOX.)

The need to share data with collaborators motivates custodians and users of relational databases (RDB) to expose relational data on the Web of Data. This document defines a direct mapping from relational data to RDF. This definition provides extension points for refinements within and outside of this document. Comments are welcome through 19 June.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-r2rml-20120529/">R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language</a>. This document describes R2RML, a language for expressing customized mappings from relational databases to RDF datasets. Such mappings provide the ability to view existing relational data in the RDF data model, expressed in a structure and target vocabulary of the mapping author's choice. R2RML mappings are themselves RDF graphs and written down in Turtle syntax. R2RML enables different types of mapping implementations. Processors could, for example, offer a virtual SPARQL endpoint over the mapped relational data, or generate RDF dumps, or offer a Linked Data interface.

Indie UI will develop an intermediate layer between device- and  modality-specific events and the functionality needed by web  applications, e.g., scrolling the view, placing focus on an object, etc. Indie UI will define a way for different user actions (e.g., scrolling via touch screen, via mouse wheel, or via voice commend) to be translated into a simple event. Then  web application developers can get these events from different devices without having to recognize how the user performed the action.

  </h3>
  <p class="date"><span class="dtstart published" title="2012-05-10T14:06:05-05:00">10 May 2012</span></p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/">Multimodal Interaction Working Group.</a> has published a Candidate Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-emotionml-20120510/">Emotion Markup Language (EmotionML) 1.0</a>. As the web is becoming ubiquitous, interactive, and multimodal, technology needs to deal increasingly with human factors, including emotions. The specification of Emotion Markup Language 1.0 aims to strike a balance between practical applicability and scientific well-foundedness. The language is conceived as a "plug-in" language suitable for use in three different areas: (1) manual annotation of data; (2) automatic recognition of emotion-related states from user behavior; and (3) generation of emotion-related system behavior.</p>
<p>The group also published <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-emotion-voc-20120510/">Vocabularies for EmotionML</a>, a Working Group Note.</p>

Today W3C launched the new <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/">Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group</a> to promote the use of linked data on the Web. Per its <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/charter.html">charter</a>, the group will explain how to use a core set of services and technologies to build powerful applications capable of integrating public data, secured enterprise data, and personal data. The platform will be based on proven Web technologies including HTTP for transport, and RDF and other Semantic Web standards for data integration and reuse. The group will produce supporting materials, such as a description of uses cases, a list of requirements, and a test suite and/or validation tools to help ensure interoperability and correct implementation.

  <p>Developers and designers are excited by the ability to use the graphical features of all modern browsers - Canvas, SVG, CSS, WebGL, and HTML5 video and audio. W3C is proud to support <a href="http://www.svgopen.org/2012/">The Graphical Web 2012</a>, which is both the first in a new international conference series on Open Web Graphics and the 10th conference on Scalable Vector Graphics, 11-14 September 2012. This year, the conference returns to Switzerland and the site of the <a href="http://www.svgopen.org/2002/">first SVG Open</a>. ETH Zürich will be hosting the conference at its Hönggerberg campus. Members of the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG Working Group</a>, including W3C Team members Chris Lilley and Doug Schepers, will be attending the conference. The SVG Working Group will also brief attendees on recent developments around the SVG specification, including SVG2 and integration with CSS3 and HTML5. The conference includes a day of instructional courses. The deadline for <a href="http://www.svgopen.org/2012/participate.shtml">presentation abstracts and course outlines</a> is 7 May.

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a> invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-WebIDL-20120419/">Web IDL</a>.  This document defines an interface definition language, Web IDL, that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in the web platform to be specified more readily. How interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to constructs within ECMAScript execution environments is also detailed in this document. It is expected that this document acts as a guide to implementors of already-published specifications, and that newly published specifications reference this document to ensure conforming implementations of interfaces are interoperable.

  Incubator Group Report: Towards a Semantic Decision Representation Format

  <p class="date"><span class="dtstart published" title="2012-04-17T09:36:30-05:00">17 April 2012</span></p>
  <p>The W3C <a href="/2005/Incubator/decision/">Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group</a> has published their final <a href="/2005/Incubator/decision/XGR-decision/">report</a>. The mission of the Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group, part of the Incubator Activity, was to determine the requirements, use cases, and a representation of decisions and decision-making in a collaborative and networked environment suitable for leading to a potential standard for decision exchange, shared situational awareness, and measurement of the speed, effectiveness, and human factors of decision-making. The Incubator Group explored the question over the last year, including use cases, requirements and formats for representing decisions in a machine-understandable format. A standardized decision format would allow the decisions that occur everyday to be managed, archived, shared, and tracked. Two key benefits include the ability to expand and advance the meaningful use of web linked data, as well as the ability to tie-in domain knowledge to provide decision context. The final report captures the major accomplishments and results of the incubator group and ends with a recommendation to transition into a W3C Working Group for the establishment of a Decision Markup Language (DecisionML).</p>
<p>This publication is part of the <a href="/2005/Incubator/">Incubator Activity</a>, a forum where W3C Members can innovate and experiment. This work is not on the W3C standards track.</p>

<ul class="show_items"><li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-dcat-20120405/">Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</a>. DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-data-cube-20120405/">The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</a>. There are many situations where it would be useful to be able to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets and concepts. The Data Cube vocabulary provides a means to do this using the W3C RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard. The model underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations. The Data Cube vocabulary is a core foundation which supports extension vocabularies to enable publication of other aspects of statistical data flows.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-people-20120405/">Terms for describing people</a>. This document defines a set of terms for describing people. It defines how to describe people's characteristics such as names or addresses and how to relate people to other things, for example to organizations or projects. For each term, guidance on the usage within a running example is provided. This document also defines mappings to widely used vocabularies to enable interoperability.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-org-20120405/">An organization ontology</a>. This document describes a core ontology for organizational structures, aimed at supporting linked-data publishing of organizational information across a number of domains.

Web application developers will no longer have to create their own or use untrusted third-party libraries for cryptographic primitives. This will improve security on the Web. Some of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/11/webcryptography-charter.html">chartered</a> use cases for this API include:</p>
<ul class="show_items">
<li>The ability to select credentials and sign statements can be necessary to perform high-value transactions such as those involved in finance, corporate security, and identity-related claims about personal data.</li>
<li>The provisioning and use of keys within Web applications can be used for scenarios such as increasing the security of user authentication and determining whether a particular device is authenticated for particular services.</li>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/Group/">SYMM Working Group</a> has published a Group Note of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-timesheets-20120328/">SMIL Timesheets 1.0</a>. This document defines an XML timing language that makes SMIL 3.0 element and attribute timing control available to a wide range of other XML languages. This language allows SMIL timing to be integrated into a wide variety of a-temporal languages, even when several such languages are combined in a compound document. Because of its similarity with external style and positioning descriptions in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language, this functionality has been termed SMIL Timesheets.

This document describes the Media Fragments 1.0 (basic) specification. It specifies the syntax for constructing media fragment URIs and explains how to handle them when used over the HTTP protocol. The syntax is based on the specification of particular name-value pairs that can be used in URI fragment and URI query requests to restrict a media resource to a certain fragment. The Media Fragment WG has no authority to update registries of all targeted media types. We recommend media type owners to harmonize their existing schemes with the ones proposed in this document and update or add the fragment semantics specification to their media type registration.

for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-rdfa-core-20120313/">RDFa Core 1.1</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-rdfa-lite-20120313/">RDFa Lite 1.1</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-xhtml-rdfa-20120313/">XHTML+RDFa 1.1</a>.</p>
<p>Together, these documents outline the vision for RDFa in a variety of
XML and HTML-based Web markup languages. RDFa Core 1.1 specifies the
core syntax and processing rules for RDFa 1.1 and how the language is
intended to be used in XML documents. RDFa Lite 1.1 provides a simple
subset of RDFa for novice web authors. XHTML+RDFa 1.1 specifies the
usage of RDFa in the XHTML markup language.</p>
<p>A number of improvements have been made to RDFa 1.1 over the past year
by working closely with Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! and the other search
engine developers. Public review and comments have resulted in a number
of further refinements to the language that eases the learning curve for
beginner Web authors.</p>
<p>The release of these Candidate Recommendation documents is a signal to
developers that the Working Group believes that each specification is
ready for implementation. The RDF Web Applications Working Group thus
kindly asks for developers across the Web to implement the specification
and provide implementation feedback via the
 <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdfa-wg/">RDF Web
Applications Working Group mailing list</a>.</p>

  <p>W3C announces today a Workshop on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/pmod/">Using Open Data: policy modeling, citizen empowerment, data journalism</a>.
For many years, W3C has been a keen promoter of Open Data, fostering a culture in which public administrations make their data available, ideally in machine-processable formats. Many governments have embraced the idea with enthusiasm, setting up national data portals. As part of the FP7-funded Crossover Project, W3C and the European Commission are running a Workshop to ask a simple question: what is all the 'new' government open data being used for? The Workshop takes place 19-20 June in Brussels, Belgium at the European Commission Headquarters. W3C Membership is not required to participate, but participation is limited to 80 people and participants must submit position papers. Workshop participants will focus on uses of open data, not its publication. In particular, the intention is that participants will highlight uses of data for tools that aid policy modeling, that empower citizens, and that can be usefully visualized for data journalism. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/pmod/">Workshop home page</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/">HTML Data Task Force, Semantic Web Interest Group</a> has published  two Notes today:</p>
<ul class="show_items"><li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-html-data-guide-20120308/">HTML Data Guide</a> aims to help publishers and consumers of HTML data. With several syntaxes (microformats, microdata, RDFa) and vocabularies (schema.org, Dublin Core, microformat vocabularies, etc.) to choose from, it provides guidance on deciding what to choose in a way that meets the publisher's or consumer's needs.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-microdata-rdf-20120308/">Microdata to RDF</a> describes processing rules that may be used to extract RDF from an HTML document containing micro data.</li></ul> 
<p>Both documents are Interest Group Notes, meaning that no further work is planned on the documents themselves, although future Working Groups may use these as input documents for further Recommendation Work.</p>

  W3C Launches Work to Simplify Creation of Content in World's Languages

</a>
Today W3C announced new work to make it easier for people to create Web content in the world's languages. The lack of standards for exchanging information about translations is estimated to cost the industry as much as 20% more in translation costs, amounting to billions of dollars. In addition, barriers to distributing content in more than one language mean lost business. Multinational companies often need to translate Web content into dozens of languages simultaneously, and public bodies from Europe and India typically must communicate with citizens in many languages. As the Web becomes more diverse linguistically, translation demands will continue to grow.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/">MultilingualWeb–LT (Language Technology) Working Group</a> will develop standard ways to support the (automatic and manual) translation and adaptation of Web content to local needs, from its creation to its delivery to end users. Read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/02/mlw-lt.html">press release</a> and learn more about the <a href="/International/">W3C Internationalization Activity</a>.

The announcement includes: "In response to calls from the Administration and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), leading Internet companies and online advertising networks are committing to use Do Not Track technology from the World Wide Web Consortium in most major web browsers to make it easier for users to control online tracking."</p>

<p>W3C is building consensus around global Web technology that will allow users to express a preference regarding being tracked online, and what is necessary to comply with the user's preference. W3C welcomes support from the US Government for the steps that industry and civil society are taking within W3C to give users meaningful privacy choices and options for consent.</p>

<p>“Personal privacy on the Web is one of the most important policy and technical issues of the decade,” said Dr. Jeff Jaffe, W3C CEO. “Standards for online consumer privacy should be developed in a global forum, led by industry, with multistakeholder participation. W3C is well-positioned as the forum to address complex online privacy issues.”</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/rdb2rdf/">RDB2RDF Working Group</a> has published two Candidate Recommendation documents that help to bring relational database information to the Semantic Web: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-r2rml-20120223/">R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-rdb-direct-mapping-20120223/">A Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF</a>. The former describes R2RML, a language for expressing customized mappings from relational databases to RDF datasets. Such mappings provide the ability to view existing relational data in the RDF data model, expressed in a structure and target vocabulary of the mapping author's choice. The latter document defines a direct mapping from relational data to RDF. Implementations are invited.

This document defines an API web page authors can use to write script-based animations where the user agent is in control of limiting the update rate of the animation. The user agent is in a better position to determine the ideal animation rate based on whether the page is currently in a foreground or background tab, what the current load on the CPU is, and so on. Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate utilization of the CPU by the browser. Comments are welcome through 20 March.

This document defines the Ontology for Media Resources 1.0. The term "Ontology" is used in its broadest possible definition: a core vocabulary. The intent of this vocabulary is to bridge the different descriptions of media resources, and provide a core set of descriptive properties. This document defines a core set of metadata properties for media resources, along with their mappings to elements from a set of existing metadata formats. Besides that, the document presents a Semantic Web compatible implementation of the abstract ontology using RDF/OWL.

Examples of interpretation of user input are a transcription into words of a raw signal, for instance derived from speech, pen or keystroke input, a set of attribute/value pairs describing their meaning, or a set of attribute/value pairs describing a gesture. The interpretation of the user's input is expected to be generated by signal interpretation processes, such as speech and ink recognition, semantic interpreters, and other types of processors for use by components that act on the user's inputs such as interaction managers.

  <p>
The W3C has launched the
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">Nu Markup Validation Service</a>,
a non-DTD-based markup validator being made available to the community in
parallel to the existing DTD-based
<a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a> W3C markup validator.
The W3C Nu Markup Validation Service uses the same backend as the
<a href="http://validator.nu/">Validator.nu</a> site, which is also the
backend for the HTML5-checking feature of
<a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a>.
The Nu Markup Validation Service is a separate, standalone validator
which provides that same HTML5-checking feature while also offering a user
interface that exposes additional options, such as full validation support
for XHTML5 documents, and the ability to validate documents that contain
features from
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa Core 1.1</a> and from

  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/">RDF Web Applications

<ul class="show_items">

</ul>
 
<p>Together, these documents outline the vision for RDFa in a variety of
XML and HTML-based Web markup languages. RDFa Core 1.1 specifies the
core syntax and processing rules for RDFa 1.1 and how the language is
intended to be used in XML documents. RDFa Lite 1.1 provides a simple
subset of RDFa for novice Web authors. XHTML+RDFa 1.1 specifies the
usage of RDFa in the XHTML markup language.</p>
 
<p>A number of improvements have been made to RDFa 1.1 over the past year
by working closely with Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! and the other search
engine developers. Public review and comments have resulted in a number
of further refinements to the language that eases the learning curve for
beginner Web authors.</p>
 
<p>The release of these documents as Last Call Working Drafts is a signal
to the public that the Working Group believes that all of the technical
requirements, public comments and reported issues have been addressed.
It is also an open invitation to the general public to review and
provide feedback on the finalization of this technology via the <a

This workshop provided a way for the community to meet and discuss some of the challenges of integration of heterogeneous data and services. With the emergence of the Web, the need for reusing data and services has become even stronger as the number of available services has grown. Different services stacks now exist from Web Services to Cloud-based services. One goal of this workshop was to figure out the needs in the domain of integration that would benefit from standardization, or where discussion via Community or Business Groups could gather a critical mass.</p>
<p>The participants came to the conclusion that solutions to the data integration issues can be the result of better integration of tools helping going cross-stacks. They also discussed how to architect RESTful services in the enterprise, with a plan to create a group to work on Linked Data Patterns, specifically REST-based patterns on RDF and other formats.</p>

  <p>W3C today published the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/09/LinkedData/Report">final report</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/09/LinkedData/">Linked Enterprise Data Workshop</a>, hosted by W3C on the 6-7 December in Cambridge, MA, USA. This workshop provided a way for the community to meet and discuss some of the challenges when deploying application relying on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">principles of Linked Data</a>. The presentations covered many different topics, ranging from the benefits a set of additional conventions would bring to specific technical issues such as the challenges of dealing with the reality that URLs do change sometimes, as well as the need for a more robust security model, and specific gaps in the current set of standards.</p>
 
<p>Participants of the Workshop agreed that W3C should create a Working Group to define a “Linked Data Platform”. This is expected to be an enumeration of specifications which constitute Linked Data, with some small additional specifications to cover specific functionality such as pagination. We anticipate a draft charter will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
