<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2008/05/21/improved-virtualown-domain-handling-and-activation/'>Improved virtual/own domain handling and activation</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 21 May 2008</p>
<p>Up until now, FastMail has always required users to "activate" their
domain before it could be used to receive email at FastMail servers.
This was previously controlled on the <strong>Options</strong> -> <strong>Virtual
Domains</strong> screen (for individual users) or <strong>Manage</strong> -> <strong>Domains</strong>
screen (for families/businesses), where the <strong>Active</strong> column would
start in a "Waiting for DNS" state and only switch to "Email &amp; Web" once
the MX records for the domain had been pointed to our servers.</p>

<p>This transition from "Waiting for DNS" to active for "Email &amp; Web" is no
longer required.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as you add a domain and appropriate aliases on the above
screens, our MX servers will immediately start accepting email for the
domain and aliases you entered. This means you can add your domain and
aliases, and immediately change the MX records to point to our servers
(see our <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/docs/faqparts/VirtualDomains.htm">FAQ</a>
for the appropriate settings), there is no need to wait for the domain
to become active, because it's active by default at our MX servers.</p>

<p>You will see that the <strong>Virtual Domains</strong>/<strong>Domains</strong> screens now have
two new columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>DNS</li>
</ul>

<p>The DNS column can be one of two values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ext - the MX records for the domain point to external servers. While
in this state, the DNS records for the domain are checked every hour
to see if they have changed</li>
<li>Us - the MX records for the domain point to our servers. While in
this state, the DNS records for the domain are only checked every
day</li>
</ol>

<p>On it's own, this column only shows what we think the state of the DNS
records for the domain are.</p>

<p>The Routing column can be one of two values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Auto (Int or Ext) - this is the default option. If the MX records
for the domain point to our servers (eg DNS = Us), then email sent
via our SMTP or Web servers is routed internally directly to the
users mailbox, and the column is listed as "Auto (Int)". If the MX
records for the domain point to external servers (eg DNS = Ext),
then email sent via our SMTP or Web servers is routed externally to
the MX records for the domain, and the column is listed as "Auto
(Ext)"</li>
<li>Force Ext - email sent via our SMTP or Web servers is always routed
externally to the MX records for the domain</li>
</ol>

<p>So now if you want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email and web hosted at FastMail - Add the domain with default
values, and any aliases you want. Change the NS servers for your
domain to point to us (see
<a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/docs/faqparts/VirtualDomains.htm">FAQ</a>)</li>
<li>Email only at FastMail - Add the domain with default values, and any
aliases you want. Change the MX or NS servers for your domain to
point to us (see
<a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/docs/faqparts/VirtualDomains.htm">FAQ</a>)</li>
<li>Web only at FastMail - Add the domain with default values, setup any
websites you want. Change the A or NS servers for your domain to
point to us (see
<a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/docs/faqparts/VirtualDomains.htm">FAQ</a>)</li>
</ul>
