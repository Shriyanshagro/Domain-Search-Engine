				<p>The result of the ICT4Ag media competition organised by CTA was announced during the closing ceremony by the chief judge Maria Protz, on Thursday 7 November. <strong>Joshua Masinde of Kenya</strong> won the First Prize.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the conference, young journalists from ACP countries were invited to submit articles on the conference theme. There were over 100 submissions. The best six were selected as semi-finalists and invited to the conference. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inoussa&nbsp;Maïga (Burkina Faso)</li>
<li>Joshua&nbsp;Masinde (Kenya)</li>
<li>Alain Georges Lietbouo (Cameroon)</li>
<li>Arison&nbsp;Mbuli Tamfu (Cameroon)</li>
<li>Sandra Margaret&nbsp;Chao (Kenya)</li>
<li>Fidelis&nbsp; Zvomuya (Zimbabwe)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Each had to produce four different pieces during the course of the week. A core panel of judges used a robust set of criteria to evaluate the stories based on journalistic quality, creativity and originality, relevance to ICT innovation, use of research and evidence to support their story, among others considerations. It was a daunting process, but in the end six semi-finalists from the ACP regions were selected and they were all busy in Kigali submitting their final entries.</p>
<p>The ICT4Ag media competition ended on Thursday 7 November at 10 am. The result was announced that very evening during the closing ceremony of the conference.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="IMG 0080" src="/images/media_awards/IMG_0080.jpg" height="427" width="640" /><br /><br />Joshua Masinde</strong> of Kenya won the First Prize trophy which was handed over to him by the European Union’s newly appointed Ambassador to Rwanda, Michael Ryan. Joshua is from Kenya where he works as a business and economic affairs journalist for the Daily Nation, the leading newspaper in East and Central Africa. His interests include but are not limited to the financial markets, agriculture, the stock market, the economy, the banking sector, foreign exchange, enterprise and personal finance.<br /><br /></p>
<p><img alt="IMG 0066" src="/images/media_awards/IMG_0066.jpg" height="427" width="640" /><br /><br />The second prize was awarded to <strong>Arison Mbuli Tamfu</strong> of Cameroon. Arison currently works as African Correspondent for Malaysia MSME News Network, an online news portal. He has also been reporting for the News Network since 2012. In addition, he is the Cameroonian-based Editor for Cameroon Journal, a daily online publication based in the USA. Prior to joining MSME News Network and Cameroon Journal he worked with Equinoxe TV and Radio as Editor-in-Chief of the English service.<br /><br /></p>
<p><img alt="IMG 0053" src="/images/media_awards/IMG_0053.jpg" height="427" width="640" /><br /><br />The third Prize was awarded to <strong>Fidelis Zvomuyu</strong> of Zimbabwe. Fidelis began his career in 2000 with the BBC. In 2003, he moved to South Africa, where he joined Caxton Magazines as a senior health journalist. He helped in the setting up of a health and environment desk and went on to become the company’s environment and agriculture editor for five magazines and a daily newspaper. He also worked for several media houses in Zimbabwe and Swaziland and covered issues on the environment, agriculture and climate change. From Caxton, Fidelis moved to Agriconnect Communication Media, where he is the editor responsible for, agricultural, environmental and development issues. He is also founding editor of an online media house Africa Green Media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, through the ICT4Ag media competition, CTA has helped to raise the bar for quality journalism that is evidence-based, factual, timely, and with strong human interest. Many think agriculture is demeaning and boring. But the truth is that agriculture can indeed by very “newsworthy and exciting”. It is in fact full of drama. There is no shortage of angles or hooks that savvy journalists can use to create high impact stories that will not only rivet readers, listeners and viewers, but which can also create lucrative niche areas for journalists that are trying to create names for themselves if they too are willing to think outside the box.</p>
<p>The best pieces produced during this final week of competition will soon be included in a special dossier of Spore, CTA’s flagship magazine.</p>			</div>

			</header>
			<div class="content clearfix">
				<p>The wait is over! CTA is delighted to announce that the six finalists in the ICT4Ag media competition have been selected.</p>
<p>Inoussa Maïga, Joshua Masinde, Alain G. Lietbouo, Fidelis Zvomuya, Arison Mbuli Tamfu and Sandra Chao will be joining us in Kigali from 4-8 November. These young journalists will contribute to the media coverage of the conference with the top three winners announced at an awards ceremony during the week.</p>
<p>In total CTA received 108 entries to the competition, 79 of which were in English and 29 in French. The international judging panel noted the high standard of competition and admitted that it was challenging to determine the overall winners.&nbsp; They also found that several journalists highlighted new ‘ICTs-for-agriculture’ &nbsp;initiatives in ACP countries making them a ‘must-read’. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first time this year, the CTA media competition did not select winners on a regional basis. Instead all journalists who entered competed against each other as a whole. Moreover, entries were only accepted in the form of print or online journalism.</p>
