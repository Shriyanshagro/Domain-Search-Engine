<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2010/01/20/yubikey-authentication-trial-on-beta-server/'>Yubikey authentication trial on beta server</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 19 January 2010</p>
<p>We're currently running a trial of
<a href="http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey/">Yubikey</a> authentication on our
beta server.</p>

<p>To enable this, just login and go to <strong>Options</strong> -> <strong>Alternate
Logins</strong>, and create a new Yubikey login set. For the Base Password,
just touch your Yubikey button to generate a new one-time code to allow
us to associate your particular Yubikey with your account. Currently
these logins only work on the beta server web interface.</p>

<p>The Yubikey is a small USB authentication device that you can use to
login to your FastMail account (beta web interface only at the moment)
instead of your regular password. The Yubikey doesn't need any client
software. You just plug it into a USB port and it acts like a USB
keyboard that most OS's automatically support. It has one button on it,
that when you press it, it generates a new one-time 44 character
password.</p>

<p>The main advantage of a Yubikey login over a regular static password
login is that to login, you must have the physical Yubikey token plugged
into your machine, and you must press the button on it to generate a new
one-time password. You can't re-enter an already used one-time password,
or copy and paste an existing one-time password. This prevents replay
attacks if someone captures any of your logins (eg keylogger, tcp dump,
malware root kit, etc).</p>

<p>Here's the way it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each device has a unique id, that's the first 12 chars</li>
<li>Each device has an internal "shared secret" AES encryption key</li>
<li>Each time you press the button, it generates a new one-time value
that encrypted with that key, that's the other 32 characters</li>
</ol>

<p>The way it generates the one-time value is like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>It takes some internal values and joins them together</li>
<li>It then encrypts that data using a symmetric cipher with the shared
AES key that's stored in the Yubikey, and also on the Yubico server
so the server can decrypt it</li>
</ol>

<p>The internal values that are joined and encrypted include:</p>

<ol>
<li>A private internal value</li>
<li>A number of counter fields (each time you plug the key into a
machine, or generate a new key, internal non-volatile counters are
incremented)</li>
<li>Timer field (an internal 8hz counter value)</li>
<li>A random number</li>
<li>A CRC checksum</li>
</ol>

<p>So at the receiving side, you get the 44 char value. The first 12 chars
normally let you work out who's key it is (we still need to ask for your
login name, because we you allow you to associate your Yubikey with
multiple different accounts if you want). With the other 32 bytes, they
are decrypted using the shared AES key, and then all the values are
checked to make sure they are valid (eg counters are all higher than
their previous values, checksum is valid, etc). There's more details at
the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/">Yubico</a> website (<a href="http://www.yubico.com/files/YubiKey_Manual_2009-12-03.pdf">PDF
manual</a>).</p>

<p>So with this approach, you can validate a login, and be sure that if
someone captures your keystrokes/one-time password value, it's useless,
because it can't be used again.</p>

<p>We don't actually store the AES key or do the decryption. That's done
with the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/">Yubico web API
service</a>. So the shared key is
stored in the Yubikey itself, and on the Yubico web service API server.</p>

<p>You can order Yubikeys from the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/o.php?refid=160&amp;rno=1767767686">Yubico website order
page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to ask more questions, there's a forum thread about this you
can check out: <a href="http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showthread.php?t=58584">Yubikey forum
thread</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 22 Jan 2010</strong>: We’ve now added a two factor Yubikey
authentication option. With this method, you need to enter both a
password, and touch your Yubikey button to generate a one-time password.
The advantage of this approach is that if you login on a machine with a
keylogger/malware/root kit that captures your username + password +
yubikey one time password, it doesn’t matter, because the yubikey one
time password can’t be reused. If someone steals your physical Yubikey,
then it doesn’t matter, because they don’t know your fixed static
password. This is why it’s called “two factor” authentication. (Of
course it doesn’t protect against the case of both the static password
and physical key being stolen, but that’s a lot less likely)</p>

<p>Off topic: Just as an FYI, this isn't related to the FastMail
implementation, but it is neat. If you're a business that wants to use
Yubikeys for authenticating people within your own organisation, you can
run your own <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/library/">Yubikey validation
server</a> rather than using the
Yubico Web API one. In that case what you'd do is before handing the
Yubikeys to people in your organisation, you'd reprogram them with
you're own <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/personalization/">new random AES
code</a>. You'd also
store that AES code on your own validation server. This means staff
could then use their Yubikey to validate against your organisations
validation server. Of course it wouldn't work for other externally run
services that validate against the Yubico web API anymore, because the
shared AES key is no longer valid in that case.</p>
