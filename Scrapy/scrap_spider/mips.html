										<B>History</B><BR>
										The MIPS processor was developed as part of a VLSI research program 
										at Stanford University in the early 80s.  Professor <A HREF="../about/interview.html">John Hennessy</A>, now
										the University's President, started the development of MIPS with a 
										brainstorming class for graduate students.  The readings and idea 
										sessions helped launch the development of the processor which became
										one of the first RISC processors, with IBM and Berkeley developing processors
										at around the same time.<P>
										
										<B>MIPS Architecture</B><BR>
										The Stanford research group had a strong background in compilers, which
										led them to develop a processor whose architecture would represent the
										lowering of the compiler to the hardware level, as opposed to the raising
										of hardware to the software level, which had been a long running design
										philosophy in the hardware industry.<P>
										
										Thus, the MIPS processor implemented a smaller, simpler instruction
										set.  Each of the instructions included in the chip design ran in a 
										single clock cycle.  The processor used a technique called <A HREF="../pipelining/index.html">pipelining</A> 
										to more efficiently process instructions.<P>
										
										MIPS used 32 registers, each 32 bits wide (a bit pattern of this size is 
										referred to as a <I>word</I>).<P>
										
										<B>Instruction Set</B><BR>
										The MIPS instruction set consists of about 111 total instructions, each represented in 32 bits.  
										An example of a MIPS instruction is below:<P>

										Above is the assembly (left) and binary (right) representation of a MIPS
										addition instruction.  The instruction tells the processor to compute the 
										sum of the values in registers 7 and 8 and store the result in register 12.  The dollar
										signs are used to indicate an operation on a register.
										The colored binary representation on the right illustrates the 6 fields of a 
										MIPS instruction.  The processor identifies the type of instruction by the 
										binary digits in the first and last fields.  In this case, the processor recogizes 
										that this instruction is an addition from the zero in its first field and the 20 in 
										its last field.<P>
										
										The operands are represented in the blue and yellow fields, and the desired result
										location is presented in the fourth (purple) field.  The orange field represents 
										the <I>shift amount</I>, something that is not used in an addition operation.<P>
										
										The instruction set consists of a variety of basic instructions, including:<P>
											<UL>
												<LI>21 arithmetic instructions (+, -, *, /, %)
												<LI>8 logic instructions (&, |, ~)
												<LI>8 bit manipulation instructions
												<LI>12 comparison instructions (&gt;, &lt;, =, &gt;=, &lt;=, &not;)
												<LI>25 branch/jump instructions
												<LI>15 load instructions
												<LI>10 store instructions
												<LI>8 move instructions
												<LI>4 miscellaneous instructions
											</UL><P>

										<B>MIPS Today</B><BR>
										MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. was founded in 1984 upon the Stanford research from
										which the first MIPS chip resulted.  The company was purchased buy Silicon Graphics, Inc. 
										in 1992, and was spun off as MIPS Technologies, Inc. in 1998.  Today, MIPS powers many consumer 
										electronics and other devices.<P>
