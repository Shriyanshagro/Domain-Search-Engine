          With features chiseled in stone, and renowned for playing a long list of historical figures, particularly in Biblical epics, the tall, well built and ruggedly handsome Charlton Heston was one of Hollywood's greatest leading men and remained active in front of movie cameras for over sixty years. As a Hollywood star, he appeared in 100 films over the course of 60 years. He played Moses in the epic film, The Ten Commandments (1956), for which he received his first Golden Globe Award nomination. He also starred in Touch of Evil (1958) with Orson Welles; Ben-Hur, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor (1959); El Cid (1961); and Planet of the Apes (1968). He also starred in the films The Greatest Show on Earth (1952); Secret of the Incas (1954); The Big Country (1958); and The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965). A supporter of Democratic politicians and civil rights in the 1960s, Heston later became a Republican, founding a conservative political action committee and supporting Ronald Reagan. Heston's most famous role in politics came as the five-term president of the National Rifle Association, from 1998 to 2003.<br /><br />Heston was born John Charles Carter on October 4, 1924, in No Man's Land, Illinois, to Lila (Charlton) and Russell Whitford Carter, who operated a sawmill. He had English and Scottish ancestry, with recent Canadian forebears.<br /><br />Heston made his feature film debut as the lead character in a 16mm production of <a href="/title/tt0034010?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Peer Gynt</a> (1941), based on the <a href="/name/nm0406585?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Henrik Ibsen</a> play. In 1944, Heston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He served for two years as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 Mitchell stationed in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands with the 77th Bombardment Squadron of the Eleventh Air Force. He reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke, who was six months his senior. That same year he joined the military.<br /><br />Heston played 'Marc Antony' in <a href="/title/tt0042622?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Julius Caesar</a> (1950), and firmly stamped himself as genuine leading man material with his performance as circus manager 'Brad Braden' in the <a href="/name/nm0001124?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Cecil B. DeMille</a> spectacular <a href="/title/tt0044672?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Greatest Show on Earth</a> (1952), also starring <a href="/name/nm0000071?ref_=nmbio_mbio">James Stewart</a> and <a href="/name/nm0664273?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Cornel Wilde</a>. The now very popular actor remained perpetually busy during the 1950s, both on TV and on the silver screen with audience pleasing performances in the steamy thriller <a href="/title/tt0047264?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Naked Jungle</a> (1954), as a treasure hunter in <a href="/title/tt0047464?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Secret of the Incas</a> (1954) and another barn storming performance for <a href="/name/nm0001124?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Cecil B. DeMille</a> as "Moses" in the blockbuster <a href="/title/tt0049833?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Ten Commandments</a> (1956).<br /><br />Heston delivered further dynamic performances in the oily film noir thriller <a href="/title/tt0052311?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Touch of Evil</a> (1958), and then alongside <a href="/name/nm0000060?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Gregory Peck</a> in the western <a href="/title/tt0051411?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Big Country</a> (1958) before scoring the role for which he is arguably best known, that of the wronged Jewish prince who seeks his freedom and revenge in the <a href="/name/nm0943758?ref_=nmbio_mbio">William Wyler</a> directed <a href="/title/tt0052618?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Ben-Hur</a> (1959). This mammoth Biblical epic running in excess of three and a half hours became the standard by which other large scale productions would be judged, and it's superb cast also including <a href="/name/nm0000963?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Stephen Boyd</a> as the villainous "Massala", English actor <a href="/name/nm0370144?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Jack Hawkins</a> as the Roman officer "Quintus Arrius", and Australian actor <a href="/name/nm0861930?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Frank Thring</a> as "Pontius Pilate", all contributed wonderful performances. Never one to rest on his laurels, steely Heston remained the preferred choice of directors to lead the cast in major historical productions and during the 1960s he starred as Spanish legend "Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar" in <a href="/title/tt0054847?ref_=nmbio_mbio">El Cid</a> (1961), as a US soldier battling hostile Chinese boxers during <a href="/title/tt0056800?ref_=nmbio_mbio">55 Days at Peking</a> (1963), played the ill-fated "John the Baptist" in <a href="/title/tt0059245?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a> (1965), the masterful painter "Michelangelo" battling Pope Julius II in <a href="/title/tt0058886?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Agony and the Ecstasy</a> (1965), and an English general in <a href="/title/tt0060588?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Khartoum</a> (1966). In 1968, Heston filmed the unusual western <a href="/title/tt0063811?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Will Penny</a> (1967) about an aging and lonely cowboy befriending a lost woman and her son, which Heston has often referred to as his favorite piece of work on screen. Interestingly, Heston was on the verge of acquiring an entirely new league of fans due to his appearance in four very topical science fiction films (all based on popular novels) painting bleak future's for mankind.<br /><br />In 1968, Heston starred as time traveling astronaut "George Taylor", in the terrific <a href="/title/tt0063442?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Planet of the Apes</a> (1968) with it's now legendary conclusion as Heston realizes the true horror of his destination. He returned to reprise the role, albeit primarily as a cameo, alongside fellow astronaut <a href="/name/nm0002082?ref_=nmbio_mbio">James Franciscus</a> in the slightly inferior sequel <a href="/title/tt0065462?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Beneath the Planet of the Apes</a> (1970). Next up, Heston again found himself facing the apocalypse in <a href="/title/tt0067525?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Omega Man</a> (1971) as the survivor of a germ plague that has wiped out humanity leaving only bands of psychotic lunatics roaming the cities who seek to kill the uninfected Heston. And fourthly, taking its inspiration from the <a href="/name/nm0365621?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Harry Harrison</a> novel "Make Room!, Make Room!", Heston starred alongside screen legend <a href="/name/nm0000064?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Edward G.

He played an evil Cardinal in the lively <a href="/title/tt0073012?ref_=nmbio_mbio">The Four Musketeers: Milady's Revenge</a> (1974), a mythical US naval officer in the recreation of <a href="/title/tt0074899?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Midway</a> (1976), also filmed in "Sensoround", an LA cop trying to stop a sniper in <a href="/title/tt0075359?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Two-Minute Warning</a> (1976) and another US naval officer in the submarine thriller <a href="/title/tt0077629?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Gray Lady Down</a> (1978).

The Q clearance is similar to a DoD or Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) clearance of Top Secret.<br /><br />Heston was married to Lydia Marie Clark Heston since March 1944, and they have two children. His highly entertaining autobiography was released in 1995, titled appropriately enough "Into The Arena". Although often criticized for his strong conservative beliefs and involvement with the NRA, Heston was a strong advocate for civil right many years before it became fashionable, and was a recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, plus the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2002, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and did appear in a film or TV production after 2003. He died in April 2008. Truly, Charlton Heston is one of the legendary figures of US cinema.<br />

      According to <a href="/name/nm0000683?ref_=nmbio_trv_93">Gore Vidal</a>, as recounted in <a href="/title/tt0112651?ref_=nmbio_trv_93">The Celluloid Closet</a> (1995), one of the script elements he was brought in to re-write for <a href="/title/tt0052618?ref_=nmbio_trv_93">Ben-Hur</a> (1959) was the relationship between Messalah and Ben-Hur. Director <a href="/name/nm0943758?ref_=nmbio_trv_93">William Wyler</a> was concerned that two men who had been close friends as youths would not simply hate one another as a result of disagreeing over politics. Thus, Vidal devised a thinly veiled subtext suggesting the Messalah and Ben-Hur had been lovers as teenagers, and their fighting was a result of Ben-Hur spurning Messalah. Wyler was initially hesitant to implement the subtext, but agreed on the conditions that no direct reference ever be made to the characters' sexuality in the script, that Vidal personally discuss the idea with <a href="/name/nm0000963?ref_=nmbio_trv_93">Stephen Boyd</a>, and not mention the subtext to Heston who, Wyler feared, would panic at the idea. After Vidal admitted to adding the homosexual subtext in public, Heston denied the claim, going so far as to suggest Vidal had little input into the final script, and his lack of screen credit was a result of his being fired for trying to add gay innuendo. Vidal rebutted by citing passages from Heston's 1978 autobiography, where the actor admitted that Vidal had authored much of the final shooting script.<br />

Lancaster also said he disagreed with the "violent morals" of the story. Three years later, in 1961 Lancaster announced his intention to produce a biopic of Michelangelo, in which he would play the title role and show the truth about the painter's homosexuality. However, he was forced to shelve this project due to the five-month filming schedule on <a href="/name/nm0899581?ref_=nmbio_trv_96">Luchino Visconti</a>'s masterpiece <a href="/title/tt0057091?ref_=nmbio_trv_96">The Leopard</a> (1963).

Even though the character is portrayed as an antagonist, Heston gained a great deal of respect for the man's real accomplishments on behalf of France. He came across a quote attributed to Richelieu: "I have no enemies, France has enemies." He liked the line so much that he insisted it be worked into the films somewhere, and he ultimately got his wish. Though slightly modified ("I have no enemies, only enemies of France."), the line appears in the second film, in the scene where Richelieu offers d'Artagnan the opportunity to be one of his soldiers.<br />

      [August 9, 2002] My Dear Friends, Colleagues and Fans: My physicians have recently told me I may have a neurological disorder whose symptoms are consistent with Alzheimer's disease. So . . . I wanted to prepare a few words for you now, because when the time comes, I may not be able to. I've lived my whole life on the stage and screen before you. I've found purpose and meaning in your response. For an actor there's no greater loss than the loss of his audience. I can part the Red Sea, but I can't part with you, which is why I won't exclude you from this stage in my life. For now, I'm not changing anything. I'll insist on work when I can; the doctors will insist on rest when I must. If you see a little less spring in my step, if your name fails to leap to my lips, you'll know why. And if I tell you a funny story for the second time, please laugh anyway. I'm neither giving up nor giving in. I believe I'm still the fighter that Dr. [<a href="/name/nm0455052?ref_=nmbio_qu_57">Martin Luther King</a>] and [<a href="/name/nm0448123?ref_=nmbio_qu_57">John F. Kennedy</a>] and <a href="/name/nm0001654?ref_=nmbio_qu_57">Ronald Reagan</a> knew, but it's a fight I must someday call a draw. I must reconcile courage and surrender in equal measure. Please feel no sympathy for me. I don't. I just may be a little less accessible to you, despite my wishes. I also want you to know that I'm grateful beyond measure. My life has been blessed with good fortune. I'm grateful that I was born in America, that cradle of freedom and opportunity, where a kid from the Michigan Northwoods can work hard and make something of his life. I'm grateful for the gift of the greatest words ever written, that let me share with you the infinite scope of the human experience. As an actor, I'm thankful that I've lived not one life, but many. Above all, I'm proud of my family ... my wife Lydia, the queen of my heart, my children, Fraser and Holly, and my beloved grandchildren, Jack, Ridley and Charlie. They're my biggest fans, my toughest critics and my proudest achievement. Through them, I can touch immortality. Finally, I'm confident about the future of America. I believe in you. I know that the future of our country, our culture and our children is in good hands. I know you will continue to meet adversity with strength and resilience, as our ancestors did, and come through with flying colors - the ones on Old Glory. <a href="/name/nm0000636?ref_=nmbio_qu_57">William Shakespeare</a>, at the end of his career, wrote his farewell through the words of Prospero, in "The Tempest". It ends like this: "Be cheerful, sir. Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-cap'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea all which it inherit, shall dissolve and, like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep". Thank you, and God bless you, everyone.<br />
