			<h3 class="entry" id="a009305"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/companies_handi.html">Companies Handing Source Code Over to Governments</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>ZDNet has an <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-pushed-tech-firms-to-hand-over-source-code/">article</a> on US government pressure on software companies to hand over copies of their source code. There's no details because no one is talking on the record, but I also believe that this is happening.</p>

<blockquote><p>When asked, a spokesperson for the Justice Dept. acknowledged that the department has demanded source code and private encryption keys before.</p></blockquote>

<p>These orders would probably come from the FISA Court:</p>

<blockquote><p>These orders are so highly classified that simply acknowledging an order's existence is illegal, even a company's chief executive or members of the board <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/when-the-feds-come-knocking-the-tale-of-a-utah-isp-a-secret-court-order-and-a-little-black-box/">may not be told</a>. Only those who are necessary to execute the order would know, and would be subject to the same secrecy provisions.

<p>Given that Federighi heads the division, it would be almost impossible to keep from him the existence of a FISA order demanding the company's source code.</p>

<p>It would not be the first time that the US government has reportedly used proprietary code and technology from American companies to further its surveillance efforts.</p>

<p>Top secret NSA documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html">reported in German magazine Der Spiegel in late-2013</a>, have suggested some hardware and software makers were compelled to hand over source code to assist in government surveillance.</p>

<p>The NSA's catalog of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html">implants and software backdoors</a> suggest that some companies, including Dell, Huawei, and Juniper -- which was publicly linked to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/juniper-flaw-is-a-major-backfire-for-governments-backdoor-plans/">an "unauthorized" backdoor</a> -- had their servers and firewall products targeted and attacked through <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/nsa_exploit_of.html">various</a> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/halluxwater_nsa.html">exploits</a>. Other exploits were able to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/iratemonk_nsa_e.html">infiltrate firmware</a> of hard drives manufactured by Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor, and Samsung.</p>

<p>Last year, antivirus maker and security firm Kaspersky later <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyberspying-idUSKBN0LK1QV20150217">found evidence</a> that the NSA had obtained source code from a number of prominent hard drive makers -- a claim the NSA denied -- to quietly install software used to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers.</p>

<p>"There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information," said one of the researchers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is, of course, is that any company forced by the US to hand over their source code would also be forbidden from talking about it.</p>

<p>It's the sort of thing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/technology/in-china-new-cybersecurity-rules-perturb-western-tech-companies.html">China does</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For most computing and networking equipment, the chart says, source code must be turned over to Chinese officials. But many foreign companies would be unwilling to disclose code because of concerns about intellectual property, security and, in some cases, United States export law.

<p>The chart also calls for companies that want to sell to banks to set up research and development centers in China, obtain permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build "ports" to allow Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardware.</p>

<p>The draft antiterrorism law pushes even further, calling for companies to store all data related to Chinese users on servers in China, create methods for monitoring content for terror threats and provide keys to encryption to public security authorities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slashdot <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/16/03/18/1547208/us-government-pushed-many-tech-firms-to-hand-over-source-code">thread</a>.</p>

	    <p>The <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FBI-Apple-CDCal-Govt-Reply.pdf">FBI's reply to Apple</a> is more of a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/the-seven-most-vitriolic-passages-in-dojs-response-to-apple/">character</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/10/apple-v-fbi-encryption-case-digital-privacy-san-bernardino">assassination</a> attempt than a legal argument. It's as if it only cares about public opinion at this point.</p>

<p>Although notice the threat in footnote 9 on page 22:</p>

<blockquote><p>For the reasons discussed above, the FBI cannot itself modify the software on Farook's iPhone without access to the source code and Apple's private electronic signature. The government did not seek to compel Apple to turn those over because it believed such a request would be less palatable to Apple. If Apple would prefer that course, however, that may provide an alternative that requires less labor by Apple programmers.</p></blockquote>

<p>This should immediately remind everyone of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">Lavabit</a> case, where the FBI did ask for the site's master key in order to get at one user. Ladar Levison <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-could-demand-apple-source-code-and-private-key-allowing-feds-to-ghost-iphones/">commented</a> on the similarities. He, of course, shut his service down rather than turn over the master key. A company as large as Apple does not have that option. Marcy Wheeler <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/14/dojs-clear-threat-to-go-after-apples-source-code/">wrote about</a> this in detail.</p>

<p>John Oliver has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjZ2r9Ygzw">great segment</a> on this. With a Matt Blaze cameo!</p>

<p>Good NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/03/14/470347719/encryption-and-privacy-are-larger-issues-than-fighting-terrorism-clarke-says">interview</a> with Richard Clarke. </p>

<blockquote><p>Well, I don't think it's a fierce debate. I think the Justice Department and the FBI are on their own here. You know, the secretary of defense has said how important encryption is when asked about this case. The National Security Agency director and three past National Security Agency directors, a former CIA director, a former Homeland Security secretary have all said that they're much more sympathetic with Apple in this case. You really have to understand that the FBI director is exaggerating the need for this and is trying to build it up as an emotional case, organizing the families of the victims and all of that. And it's Jim Comey and the attorney general is letting him get away with it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Senator Lindsay Graham is <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/10/apple-fbi-lindsay-graham/">changing his views</a>:</p>

			<h3 class="entry" id="a007857"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/judge_demands_t.html">Judge Demands that Apple Backdoor an iPhone</a></h3>
			
	
	
    
	    <p>A judge <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001/SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.pdf">has ordered</a> that Apple bypass iPhone security in order for the FBI to attempt a brute-force password attack on an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino killers. Apple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html">is</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-wants-apple-to-help-unlock-iphone-used-by-san-bernardino-shooter/2016/02/16/69b903ee-d4d9-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.html">refusing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001/SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.pdf">The order</a> is pretty specific technically. This implies to me that what the FBI is asking for is technically possible, and even that Apple assisted in the wording so that the case could be about the legal issues and not the technical ones.</p>

<p>From Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">statement</a> about its refusal:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution. But it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case.

<p>In today's digital world, the "key" to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.</p>

<p>The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks ­ from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.</p>

<p>The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers ­ including tens of millions of American citizens ­ from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.</p>

<p>We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/article/16210#.VqBNGn5GsCI.twitter">Here's</a> an interesting essay about why Tim Cook and Apple are such champions for encryption and privacy.</p>

<p>Today I walked by a television showing CNN. The sound was off, but I saw an aerial scene which I presume was from San Bernardino, and the words "Apple privacy vs. national security." If that's the framing, we lose. I would have preferred to see "National security vs. FBI access."</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/18): Good <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/how-apple-will-fight-the-doj-in-iphone-backdoor-crypto-case/">analysis</a> of Apple's case. Interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/02/18/crimes-iphones-and-encryption">debate</a>.

<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/19): Ben Adida <a href="https://benlog.com/2016/02/18/on-apple-and-the-fbi/">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What's probably happening is that the FBI is using this as a test case for the general principle that they should be able to compel tech companies to assist in police investigations. And that's pretty smart, because it's a pretty good test case: Apple obviously wants to help prevent terrorist attacks, so they're left to argue the slippery slope argument in the face of an FBI investigation of a known terrorist. Well done, FBI, well done.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Julian Sanchez's <a href="http://time.com/4229601/real-reason-apple-is-fighting-the-fbi/">comments</a>. His conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>These, then, are the high stakes of Apple's resistance to the FBI's order: not whether the federal government can read one dead terrorism suspect's phone, but whether technology companies can be conscripted to undermine global trust in our computing devices. That's a staggeringly high price to pay for any investigation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, two questions: One, what do we know about <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/apple-unlocked-70-iphones-refusal-article-1.2536178">Apple's assistance in the past</a>, and why this one is different? Two, has anyone speculated on how much this will cost Apple? The FBI is demanding that Apple give them free engineering work. What's the value of that work?</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD (2/20): Jonathan Zdziarski writes on the differences between the FBI compelling someone to provide a service versus <a href="http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5645">build a tool</a>, and why the latter will 1) be difficult and expensive, 2) will get out into the wild, and 3) set a dangerous precedent. </p>

<p>This answers my first question, above:</p>

<blockquote><p>For years, the government could come to Apple with a subpoena and a phone, and have the manufacturer provide a disk image of the device. This largely worked because Apple didn't have to hack into their phones to do this. Up until iOS 8, the encryption Apple chose to use in their design was easily reversible when you had code execution on the phone (which Apple does). So all through iOS 7, Apple only needed to insert the key into the safe and provide FBI with a copy of the data.</p></blockquote>

<p>EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/technical-perspective-apple-iphone-case">wrote a good technical explainer</a> on the case. My only complaint is with the last section. I have heard directly from Apple that this technique still works on current model phones using the current iOS version.</p>

<p>I am still stunned by how good a case the FBI chose to push this. They have all the sympathy in the media that they could hope for.</p>

	    <p>On Thursday, a Brazilian judge <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/17/news/companies/brazil-blocks-whatsapp/">ordered the text messaging service WhatsApp shut down for 48 hours</a>. It was a monumental action.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is the most popular app in Brazil, used by about 100 million people. The Brazilian telecoms hate the service because it entices people away from more expensive text messaging services, and they have been lobbying for months to convince the government that it's unregulated and illegal. A judge finally agreed.</p>

<p>In Brazil's case, WhatsApp was blocked for allegedly failing to respond to a court order. Another judge <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/brazilian-court-pulls-the-plug-on-whatsapp/">reversed the ban</a> 12 hours later, but there is a pattern forming here. In Egypt, Vodafone has <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/technology/2015/03/10/Egypt-s-Vodafone-questions-legality-of-WhatsApp-Voice-in-the-country.html">complained</a> about the legality of WhatsApp's free voice-calls, while India's telecoms firms have been <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Net-neutrality-DoT-favours-regulation-of-WhatsApp-Viber-calls/articleshow/48097355.cms">lobbying hard</a> to curb messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Viber. Earlier this year, the United Arab Emirates <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/uae/whatsapp-calls-blocked-in-uae-says-telecoms-firm/ar-AAakyoD">blocked WhatsApp's free voice call feature</a>.</p>

<p>All this is part of a massive power struggle going on right now between traditional companies and new Internet companies, and we're all in the blast radius.</p>

<p>It's one aspect of a tech policy problem that has been plaguing us for at least 25 years: technologists and policymakers don't understand each other, and they inflict damage on society because of that. But it's worse today. The speed of technological progress makes it worse. And the types of technology­ -- especially the current Internet of mobile devices everywhere, cloud computing, always-on connections and the Internet of Things -- ­make it worse.</p>

<p>The Internet has been disrupting and destroying long-standing business models since its popularization in the mid-1990s. And traditional industries have long fought back with every tool at their disposal. The movie and music industries have tried for decades to hamstring computers in an effort to prevent illegal copying of their products. Publishers have battled with Google over whether their books could be indexed for online searching.</p>

<p>More recently, municipal taxi companies and large hotel chains are fighting with ride-sharing companies such as Uber and apartment-sharing companies such as Airbnb. Both the old companies and the new upstarts have tried to bend laws to their will in an effort to outmaneuver each other.</p>

<p>Sometimes the actions of these companies harm the users of these systems and services. And the results can seem crazy. Why would the Brazilian telecoms want to provoke the ire of almost everyone in the country? They're trying to protect their monopoly. If they win in not just shutting down WhatsApp, but <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10386776/brazil-whatsapp-ban-telegram-millions-users">Telegram</a> and all the other text-message services, their customers will have no choice. This is how high-stakes these battles can be.</p>

<p>This isn't just companies competing in the marketplace. These are battles between competing visions of how technology should apply to business, and traditional businesses and "disruptive" new businesses. The fundamental problem is that technology and law are in conflict, and what's worked in the past is increasingly failing today.</p>

<p>First, the speeds of technology and law have reversed. Traditionally, new technologies were adopted slowly over decades. There was time for people to figure them out, and for their social repercussions to percolate through society. Legislatures and courts had time to figure out rules for these technologies and how they should integrate into the existing legal structures.</p>

<p>They don't always get it right --­ the sad history of copyright law in the United States is an example of how they can get it badly wrong again and again­ -- but at least they had a chance before the technologies become widely adopted.</p>

<p>That's just not true anymore. A new technology can go from zero to a hundred million users in a year or less. That's just too fast for the political or legal process. By the time they're asked to make rules, these technologies are well-entrenched in society.</p>

<p>Second, the technologies have become more complicated and specialized. This means that the normal system of legislators passing laws, regulators making rules based on those laws and courts providing a second check on those rules fails. None of these people has the expertise necessary to understand these technologies, let alone the subtle and potentially pernicious ramifications of any rules they make.</p>

<p>We see the same thing between governments and law-enforcement and militaries. In the United States, we're expecting policymakers to understand the debate between the FBI's desire to read the encrypted e-mails and computers of crime suspects and the security researchers who maintain that giving them that capability will render everyone insecure. We're expecting legislators to provide meaningful oversight over the National Security Agency, when they can only read highly technical documents about the agency's activities in special rooms and without any aides who might be conversant in the issues.</p>

<p>The result is that we end up in situations such as the one Brazil finds itself in. WhatsApp went from zero to 100 million users in five years. The telecoms are advancing all sorts of weird legal arguments to get the service banned, and judges are ill-equipped to separate fact from fiction.</p>

<p>This isn't a simple matter of needing government to get out of the way and let companies battle in the marketplace. These companies are for-profit entities, and their business models are so complicated that they regularly don't do what's best for their users. (For example, remember that you're not really Facebook's customer. You're their product.)</p>

<p>The fact that people's resumes are effectively the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/futureoftheinternet/2014/05/15/the-ten-things-that-define-you/">first 10 hits</a> on a Google search of their name is a problem --­ something that the European "right to be forgotten" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/opinion/dont-force-google-to-forget.html">tried ham-fistedly</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/personaltech/right-to-be-forgotten-online-is-poised-to-spread.html">to address</a>. There's a lot of <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/getting-over-uber-fdf75faf7f6e">smart writing</a> that says that Uber's disruption of traditional taxis will be worse for the people who regularly use the services. And many people worry about Amazon's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/personaltech/right-to-be-forgotten-online-is-poised-to-spread.html">increasing dominance</a> of the publishing industry.</p>

<p>We need a better way of regulating new technologies.</p>

<p>That's going to require bridging the gap between technologists and policymakers. Each needs to understand the other ­-- not enough to be experts in each other's fields, but enough to engage in meaningful conversations and debates. That's also going to require laws that are agile and written to be as technologically invariant as possible.</p>

<p>It's a tall order, I know, and one that has been on the wish list of every tech policymaker for decades. But today, the stakes are higher and the issues come faster. Not doing so will become increasingly harmful for all of us.</p>

	    <p>Last month, <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/29650818/hillview-man-arrested-for-shooting-down-drone-cites-right-to-privacy">a Kentucky man</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/31/428156902/dispute-emerges-over-drone-shot-down-by-kentucky-man">shot down a drone</a> that was hovering near his backyard.</p>

<p>WDRB News reported that the camera drone's owners soon showed up at the home of the shooter, William H. Merideth: "Four guys came over to confront me about it, and I happened to be armed, so that changed their minds," Merideth said. "They asked me, 'Are you the S-O-B that shot my drone?' and I said, 'Yes I am,'" he said. "I had my 40 mm Glock on me and they started toward me and I told them, 'If you cross my sidewalk, there's gonna be another shooting.'" Police charged Meredith with criminal mischief and wanton endangerment.</p>

<p>This is a trend. People have<a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/09/30/new-jersey-man-accused-of-shooting-down-neighbors-remote-control-drone/"> shot down drones in southern New Jersey</a> and<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/man-shoots-downs-neighbors-hexacopter-in-rural-drone-shotgun-battle/"> rural California</a> as well. It's illegal, and they get arrested for it.</p>

<p>Technology changes everything. Specifically, it upends long-standing societal balances around issues like security and privacy. When a capability becomes possible, or cheaper, or more common, the changes can be far-reaching. Rebalancing security and privacy after technology changes capabilities can be very difficult, and take years. And we're not very good at it.</p>

<p>The security threats from drones are real, and the government is taking them seriously. In January, a man lost control of his drone,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/device-found-on-white-house-grounds-but-officials-say-it-posed-no-threat/2015/01/26/7accc156-a547-11e4-a2b2-776095f393b2_story.html"> which crashed on the White House lawn</a>. In May, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/14/politics/white-house-drone-arrest/">another man was arrested </a> for trying to fly his drone over the White House fence, and another last week for flying a drone <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/man-arrested-for-allegedly-crashing-drone-into-stands-at-us-open/">into the stadium</a> where the U.S. Open was taking place.</p>

<p>Drones have attempted to deliver drugs to prisons<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-prison-drone-20150824-story.html"> in Maryland</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/04/drone-drug-delivery-ohio-prison-fight-heroin-marijuana-tobacco">Ohio</a> and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/drone-carrying-drugs-phones-crashes-south-carolina-prison/story?id=24791025">South Carolina </a>­so far.</p>

<p>There have been many <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/us/drone-airliner-jfk/">near-misses </a>between drones and airplanes. <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-22/when-terrorists-have-drones">Many</a><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/criminals-terrorists-find-uses-for-drones-raising-concerns-1422494268"></a><a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-22/when-terrorists-have-drones"> people </a><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/drone-terrorism-threat-is-serious-concern-for-nypd/"></a><a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-22/when-terrorists-have-drones">have written</a> about the possible terrorist uses of drones.</p>

<p>Defenses are being developed. Both <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2012/november/1127-ss-adam.html">Lockheed Martin</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/welcome-world-drone-killing-laser-cannon/">Boeing</a> sell anti-drone laser weapons. One company <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/24/drone-munition-new-line-ammo-company-meant-protect/">sells</a> shotgun shells specifically <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/drones/how-to/a16756/how-to-shoot-down-a-drone/">designed</a> to shoot down drones.</p>

<p>Other companies are <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21650071-hands-criminals-small-drones-could-be-menace-now-time">working </a>on technologies to detect and disable them safely. Some of those technologies were used to provide security at this year's <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/21/boston-marathon-drone-detection-firm-brought-net-guns/2oSp9Brfn5rFOIYqRJmP3H/story.html">Boston Marathon.</a></p>

<p>Law enforcement can deploy these technologies, but under <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/theres-a-drone-flying-over-my-house-can-i-shoot-125546065994.html">current law </a>it's <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/18/no-you-cant-shoot-down-drones-over-your-house/"> illegal</a> to shoot down a drone, even if it's hovering above your own property. In our society, you're generally not allowed to take the law into your own hands. You're expected to call the police and let them deal with it.</p>

<p>There's an alternate theory, though, from law professor Michael Froomkin. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504325">He argues</a> that self-defense should be permissible against drones simply because you don't know their capabilities. We know, for example, that people <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21650071-hands-criminals-small-drones-could-be-menace-now-time">have mounted</a> guns on drones, which means they could pose a threat to life. Note that this legal theory has not been tested in court.</p>

<p>Increasingly, government is <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2014/09/civilian-drones-and-privacy"> regulating drones</a> and drone flights both at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/25/state-legislation-governing-private-drone-use/">state level</a> and by the <a href="http://www.uavm.com/images/AFS-400_05-01_faa_uas_policy.pdf">FAA</a>. There are proposals to require that drones have an <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2013/07/12/Drone-UAV-sense-and-avoid-technologies-civilian-airspace.aspx?m=1&amp;Page=1">identifiable transponder</a>, or <a href="http://www.roboticstrends.com/article/dji_blocks_drone_flights_in_washington_dc_after_white_house_crash   no-fly zones"> no-fly zones</a> programmed into the drone software.</p>

<p>Still, a large number of security issues remain unresolved. How do we feel about drones with long-range <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/us-navy-cicada-drones-surveillance-swarms/">listening devices</a>, for example? Or drones <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/25/seattle-woman-spots-drone-outside-her-26th-floor-apartment-window-feels-violated/">hovering outside</a> our property and photographing us through our windows?</p>

<p>What's going on is that drones have changed how we think about security and privacy within our homes, by removing the protections we used to get from fences and walls. Of course, being spied on and shot at from above is nothing new, but access to those technologies was expensive and largely the purview of governments and some corporations. Drones put these capabilities into the hands of hobbyists, and we don't know what to do about it.</p>

<p>The issues around drones will get worse as we move from remotely piloted aircraft to true drones: aircraft that operate autonomously from a computer program. For the first time, autonomous robots -- ­with ever-increasing intelligence and capabilities at an ever-decreasing cost -- ­will have access to public spaces. This will create serious problems for society, because our legal system is largely based on deterring human miscreants rather than their proxies.</p>

<p>Our desire to shoot down a drone hovering nearby is understandable, given its potential threat. Society's need for people not to take the law into their own hands­ -- and especially not to fire guns into the air­ -- is also understandable. These two positions are increasingly coming into conflict, and will require increasing government regulation to sort out. But more importantly, we need to rethink our assumptions of security and privacy in a world of autonomous drones, long-range cameras, face recognition, and the myriad other technologies that are increasingly in the hands of everyone.</p>

	    <p>The US government has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/10/us-no-fly-list-predictive-assessments">admitted</a> that it uses predictive assessments to put people on the no-fly list:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a little-noticed filing before an Oregon federal judge, the US Justice Department and the FBI conceded that stopping US and other citizens from travelling on airplanes is a matter of "predictive assessments about potential threats," the government asserted in May.

<p>"By its very nature, identifying individuals who 'may be a threat to civil aviation or national security' is a predictive judgment intended to prevent future acts of terrorism in an uncertain context," Justice Department officials Benjamin C Mizer and Anthony J Coppolino told the court on 28 May.</p>

<p>"Judgments concerning such potential threats to aviation and national security call upon the unique prerogatives of the Executive in assessing such threats."</p>

<p>It is believed to be the government's most direct acknowledgement to date that people are not allowed to fly because of what the government believes they might do and not what they have already done.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you have a secret process that can judge and penalize people without due process or oversight, this is the kind of thing that happens.</p>

	    <p>A Kentucky man <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/kentucky-man-shoots-down-drone-hovering-over-his-backyard/">shot down</a> a drone that was hovering in his backyard:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was just right there," he told Ars. "It was hovering, I would never have shot it if it was flying. When he came down with a video camera right over my back deck, that's not going to work. I know they're neat little vehicles, but one of those uses shouldn't be flying into people's yards and videotaping."

<p>Minutes later, a car full of four men that he didn't recognize rolled up, "looking for a fight."</p>

<p>"Are you the son of a bitch that shot my drone?" one said, according to Merideth.</p>

<p>His terse reply to the men, while wearing a 10mm Glock holstered on his hip: "If you cross that sidewalk onto my property, there's going to be another shooting."</p></blockquote>

<p>He was arrested, but <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/07/29/shoot-drone-privacy/">what's the law</a>?</p>

<blockquote><p>In the view of drone lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws">Brendan Schulman</a> and robotics law professor <a href="https://twitter.com/rcalo?lang=en">Ryan Calo</a>, home owners can't just start shooting when they see a drone over their house. The reason is because the law frowns on self-help when a person can just call the police instead. This means that Meredith may not have been defending his house, but instead engaging in criminal acts and property damage for which he could have to pay.

<p>But a different and bolder argument, put forward by law professor Michael Froomkin, could provide Meredith some cover. In <a href="http://robots.law.miami.edu/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Froomkin-Colangelo-Self-Defence-Against-Robots-March-2014.pdf">a paper</a>, Froomkin argues that it's reasonable to assume robotic intrusions are not harmless, and that people may have a right to "employ violent self-help."</p></blockquote>

<p>Froomkin's paper is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504325">well worth reading</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Robots can pose -- or can appear to pose -- a threat to life, property, and privacy. May a landowner legally shoot down a trespassing drone? Can she hold a trespassing autonomous car as security against damage done or further torts? Is the fear that a drone may be operated by a paparazzo or a peeping Tom sufficient grounds to disable or interfere with it? How hard may you shove if the office robot rolls over your foot? This paper addresses all those issues and one more: what rules and standards we could put into place to make the resolution of those questions easier and fairer to all concerned.

<p>The default common-law legal rules governing each of these perceived threats are somewhat different, although reasonableness always plays an important role in defining legal rights and options. In certain cases -- drone overflights, autonomous cars, national, state, and even local regulation -- may trump the common law. Because it is in most cases obvious that humans can use force to protect themselves against actual physical attack, the paper concentrates on the more interesting cases of (1) robot (and especially drone) trespass and (2) responses to perceived threats other than physical attack by robots notably the risk that the robot (or drone) may be spying - perceptions which may not always be justified, but which sometimes may nonetheless be considered reasonable in law.</p>

<p>We argue that the scope of permissible self-help in defending one's privacy should be quite broad. There is exigency in that resort to legally administered remedies would be impracticable; and worse, the harm caused by a drone that escapes with intrusive recordings can be substantial and hard to remedy after the fact. Further, it is common for new technology to be seen as risky and dangerous, and until proven otherwise drones are no exception. At least initially, violent self-help will seem, and often may be, reasonable even when the privacy threat is not great -- or even extant. We therefore suggest measures to reduce uncertainties about robots, ranging from forbidding weaponized robots to requiring lights, and other markings that would announce a robot's capabilities, and RFID chips and serial numbers that would uniquely identify the robot's owner.</p>

<p>The paper concludes with a brief examination of what if anything our survey of a person's right to defend against robots might tell us about the current state of robot rights against people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that there are drones that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHrTtvFFIs">shoot back</a>.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/robot-futures">two</a> <a href="http://thenewpress.com/books/theory-of-drone">books</a> that talk about these topics.
