Seems like we&#39;re always finding new ransomware.&nbsp; In early March 2016, BleepingComputer announced a new ransomware named Cerber had appeared near the end of February [1].&nbsp; A few days later, Malwarebytes provided further analysis and more details on subsequent Cerber samples [2].

I&#39;ve seen Cerber distributed through exploit kits (EKs) and malicious spam (malspam).&nbsp; I&#39;m only aware of .rtf attachments that download and install Cerber when opened in Microsoft Word [3" href="/forums/diary/Neutrino+exploit+kit+sends+Cerber+ransomware/21017/">Neutrino exploit kit sends Cerber ransomware</a><br />
