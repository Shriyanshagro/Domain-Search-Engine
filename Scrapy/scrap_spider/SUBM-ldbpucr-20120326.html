<h1 id="scope">1. Scope and Motivation</h1>
<div>
<p>Linked Data was defined by Tim Berners-Lee with the
following [4Rules]</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1. Use URIs as
names for things</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2. Use HTTP URIs
so that people can look up those names</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3. When someone
looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>4. Include links
to other URIs. so that they can discover more things</p>

<p>These four rules have proven very effective in guiding and
inspiring people to <i>publish</i> Linked Data on the web. The amount of data,
especially public data, available on the web has grown rapidly, and an
impressive number of extremely creative and useful “mashups” has been created
using this data as result.</p>

<p>There has been much less focus on the potential of Linked
Data as a model for <i>managing</i> data on the web - the majority of the
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available on the Internet for
creating and updating data follow a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model rather
than a Linked Data model.</p>

<p>If Linked Data were just another model for doing something
that RPC models can already do, it would be of only marginal interest. Interest
in Linked Data arises from the fact that applications with an interface
defined using Linked Data can be much more easily and seamlessly integrated
with each other than applications that offer an RPC interface. In many problem
domains, the most important problems and the greatest value are found not in
the implementation of new applications, but in the successful integration of
multiple applications into larger systems.</p>

<p>Some of the features that make Linked Data exceptionally
well suited for integration include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A single interface – defined by the HTTP methods – that
     is universally understood and is constant across all applications. This is
     in contrast with the RPC architecture where each application has a unique
     interface that has to be learned and coded to.</li>
 <li>A universal addressing scheme – provided by HTTP URLs
     – for both identifying and accessing all “entities”. This is in contrast
     with the RPC architecture where there is no uniform way to either identify
     or access data.</li>
 <li>A simple yet extensible data model – provided by RDF
     – for describing data about a resource in a way which doesn’t require
     prior knowledge of vocabulary being used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience implementing applications and integrating them
using Linked Data has shown very promising results, but has also demonstrated
that the original four rules defined by Tim Berners-Lee for Linked Data are not
sufficient to guide and constrain a writable Linked Data API. As was the case
with the original four rules, the need generally is not for the invention of
fundamental new technologies, but rather for a series of additional rules and
patterns that guide and constrain the use of existing technologies in the
construction of a Basic Profile for Linked Data to achieve interoperability.</p>

<p>The following list illustrates a few of the issues that
require additional rules and patterns:</p>

<ul>
 <li>What URLs do I post to in order to create new
     resources?</li>
 <li>How do I get lists of existing resources, and how do
     I get basic information about them without having to access each one?</li>
 <li>How should I detect and deal with race conditions on
     write?</li>
 <li>What media-types/representations should I use?</li>
 <li>What standard vocabularies should I use?</li>
 <li>What primitive data types should I use?</li>
</ul>

<p>A good goal for the Basic Profile for Linked Data would be to
define a specification required to allow the definition of a writable Linked
Data API equivalent to the simple application APIs that are often written on
the web today using the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP). APP shares some
characteristics with Linked Data, such as the use of HTTP and URLs. One difference is that Linked Data relies on a
flexible data model with RDF, which allows for multiple representations.</p>
</div>

<h1 id="usecases">2. Use Cases</h1>
<div>
<p>This section collects a limited number of high-level use
cases to illustrate the need for a Basic Profile for Linked Data, both for data
consumption and for the creation and modification of data. The W3C maintains a repository of Semantic
Web Case Studies and Use Cases [SEMWEB-UC]. Some of that material may apply to
the Use Cases for the Basic Profile for Linked Data and will be called out in
the following sections where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="social">2.1 Maintaining Social Contact Information</h2>
<div>
<p>Many of us have multiple email accounts that include
information about the people and organizations we interact with – names, email
addresses, telephone numbers, instant messenger identities and so on. When someone’s email address or telephone
number changes (or they acquire a new one), our lives would be much simpler if
we could update that information in one spot and all copies of it would
automatically be updated. In other
words, those copies would all be linked to some definition of “the
contact.” There might also be good
reasons (like off-line email addressing) to maintain a local copy of the
contact, but ideally any copies would still be linked to some central “master.”</p>

<p>Agreeing on a format for “the contact” is not enough,
however. Even if all our email providers
agreed on the format of a contact, we would still need to use each provider’s
custom interface to update or replace the provider’s copy, or we would have to
agree on a way for each email provider to link to the “master”. If we look outside our own personal
interests, it would be even more useful if the person or organization exposed
their own contact information so we could link to it.</p>

<p>What would work in either case is a common understanding of the resource, a few formats needed, and 
access guidance for these resources. This would support how to acquire a link to a contact, and how to use those links to interact with a 
contact (including reading, updating, and deleting it), as well as how to easily create a 
new contact and add it to my contacts and when deleting a contact, how it would be removed 
from my list of contacts. It would also be good to be able to add
some application-specific data about my contacts that the original design
didn’t consider. Ideally we’d like to eliminate multiple copies of contacts,
there would be additional valuable information about my contacts that may be
stored on separate servers and need a simple way to link this information back
to the contacts. Regardless of whether a contact collection is my own, shared
by an organization, or all contacts known to an email provider (or to a single
email account at an email provider), it would be nice if they all worked pretty
much the same way.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="bizrel">2.2 Keeping Track of Personal and Business Relationships</h2>
<div>
<p>In our daily lives, we deal with many different
organizations in many different relationships, and they each have data about us. However, it is unlikely that any one
organization has all the information about us. Each of them typically gives us access to the
information (at least some of it), many through websites where we are uniquely
identified by some string – an account number, user ID, and so on. We have to use their applications to interact
with the data about us, however, and we have to use their identifier(s) for
us. If we want to build any semblance of
a holistic picture of ourselves (more accurately, collect all the data about us
that they externalize), we as humans must use their custom applications to find
the data, copy it, and organize it to suit our needs.</p>

<p>Would it not be simpler if at least the Web-addressable
portion of that data could be linked to consistently, so that instead of
maintaining various identifiers in different formats and instead of having to
manually supply those identifiers to each one’s corresponding custom
application, we could essentially build a set of bookmarks to it all? When we want to examine or change their
contents, would it not be simpler if there were a single consistent application
interface that they all supported? Of
course it would.</p>


<p>Our set of links would probably be a simple collection. The information held by any single
organization might be a mix of simple data and collections of other data, for
example, a bank account balance and a collection of historical
transactions. Our bank might easily have
a collection of accounts for each of its collection of customers.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="oslc">2.3 System and Software Development Tool Integration</h2>
<div>
<p>System and software development tools typically come from a
diverse set of vendors and are built on various architectures and
technologies. These tools are purpose
built to meet the needs for a specific domain scenario (modeling, design,
requirements and so on.) Often tool vendors view integrations with other
tools as a necessary evil rather than providing additional value to their
end-users. Even more of an afterthought
is how these tools’ data -- such as people, projects, customer-reported problems
and needs -- integrate and relate to corporate and external applications that
manage data such as customers, business priorities and market trends. The
problem can be isolated by standardizing on a small set of tools or a set of
tools from a single vendor, but this rarely occurs and if does it usually does
so only within small organizations. As
these organizations grow both in size and complexity, they have needs to work
with outsourced development and diverse internal other organizations with their
own set of tools and processes. There is a need for better support of more
complete business processes (system and software development processes) that
span the roles, tasks, and data addressed by multiple tools. This demand has
existed for many years, and the tools vendor industry has tried several different
architectural approaches to address the problem. Here are a few:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Implement an API for
     each application, and then, in each application, implement “glue code”
     that exploits the APIs of other applications to link them together.</li>
 <li>Design a single
     database to store the data of multiple applications, and implement each of
     the applications against this database. In the software development tools
     business, these databases are often called “repositories.”</li>
 <li>Implement a central
     “hub” or “bus” that orchestrates the broader business process by
     exploiting the APIs described previously.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is fair to say that although each of those approaches
has its adherents and can point to some successes, none of them is wholly
satisfactory. The use of Linked Data as an application integration technology
has a strong appeal. [OSLC]</p>
</div>

<h2 id="lld">2.4 Library Linked Data</h2>
<div>
<p>The W3C Library Linked Data working group has a number of
use cases cited in their Use Case Report. [LLD-UC] These referenced use cases focus on the need
to extract and correlate library data from disparate sources. Variants of these use cases that can provide
consistent formats, as well as ways to improve or update the data, would enable
simplified methods for both efficiently sharing this data as well as producing
incremental updates without the need for repeated full extractions and import
of data.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="city">2.5 Municipality Operational Monitoring</h2>
<div>
<p>
Across various cities, towns, counties, and various municipalities there is a growing number of services 
managed and run by municipalities that produce and consume a vast amount of information. 
This information is used to help monitor
services, predict problems, and handle logistics. In order to effectively and efficiently
collect, produce, and analyze all this data, a fundamental set of loosely
coupled standard data sources are needed. A simple, low-cost way to expose data from the diverse set of monitored services
is needed, one that can easily integrate into the municipalities of other
systems that inspect and analyze the data. All these services have links and dependencies on other data and
services, so having a simple and scalable linking model is key.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="hc">2.6 Healthcare</h2>
<div>
<p>For physicians to analyze, diagnose, and propose treatment
for patients requires a vast amount of complex, changing and growing
knowledge. This knowledge needs to come
from a number of sources, including physicians’ own subject knowledge, consultation
with their network of other healthcare professionals, public health sources,
food and drug regulators, and other repositories of medical research and
recommendations.</p>

<p>To diagnose a patient’s condition requires current data on the
patient’s medications and medical history. In addition, recent pharmaceutical advisories about these medications are
linked into the patient’s data. If the
patient experiences adverse affects from medications, these physicians need to
publish information about this to an appropriate regulatory source. Other medical professionals require access to
both validated and emerging effects of the medication. Similarly, if there are geographical patterns
around outbreaks that allow both the awareness of new symptoms and treatments,
this information needs to quickly reach a very distributed and diverse set of
medical information systems. Also,
reporting back to these regulatory agencies regarding new occurrences of an
outbreak, including additional details of symptoms and causes, is critical in producing
the most effective treatment for future incidents.</p>
