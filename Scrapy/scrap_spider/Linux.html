  <p>In an <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/7/3/2332494">announcement for the 2.6.25.10 stable kernel</a>, Greg KH noted, "<i>it contains a number of assorted bugfixes all over the tree.  And once again, any users of the 2.6.25 kernel series are STRONGLY encouraged to upgrade to this release.</i>"  The emphasis on the word <em>strongly</em> led to a lengthy discussion about how security fixes are handled in the Linux Kernel.  Linus Torvalds <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/7/15/2497674">replied</a>, "<i>I personally consider security bugs to be just 'normal bugs'. I don't cover them up, but I also don't have any reason what-so-ever to think it's a good idea to track them and announce them as something special.</i>"  Later in the thread he went on to explain, "<i>one reason I refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that I think it glorifies - and thus encourages - the wrong behavior.  It makes 'heroes' out of security people, as if the people who don't just fix normal bugs aren't as important.  In fact, all the boring normal bugs are _way_ more important, just because there's a lot more of them. I don't think some spectacular security hole should be glorified or cared about as being any more 'special' than a random spectacular crash due to bad locking.</i>"</p>
<p>Theodore T'so <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/7/15/2508024">pointed out</a> that other developers had different beliefs about disclosure than Linus and referred to mailing lists such as the private security@ list described in the <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://git.kernel.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SecurityBugs;h=26c3b3635d9fa1b017f2b23e35c342fb92e76977;hb=HEAD">SecurityBugs documentation</a>, originally <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://kerneltrap.org/node/4540">created in early 2005</a>.  He then described Linus' stance, "<i>if Linus finds out about a security bug, he will fix it and check it into the public git repository right away.  But he's very honest in telling you that is what he will do --- so you can choose whether or not to include him in any disclosures that you might choose to make.</i>"  Regarding whether Full Disclosure is the best policy, Ted highlighted the fact that the debate has been going on for several decades, "<i>it is clear that we're not going settle this debate now, and certainly not on the Linux Kernel Mailing List.</i>"  Later in the discussion, Linus offered a succinct summary of his viewpoint, "<i>my responsibility is to do a good job. And not pander to the people who want to turn security into a media circus.</i>"</p><div class="autolinks">Submit to: <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure&amp;title=Security%20Bugs%20and%20Full%20Disclosure">Reddit</a>, <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure&amp;title=Security%20Bugs%20and%20Full%20Disclosure">Digg</a>, <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://slashdot.org/submit.pl?url=http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure&amp;title=Security%20Bugs%20and%20Full%20Disclosure">Slashdot</a>, <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure&amp;title=Security%20Bugs%20and%20Full%20Disclosure">Del.icio.us</a>, <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://osnews.com/submit.php?url=http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure&amp;title=Security%20Bugs%20and%20Full%20Disclosure">OSNews</a></div>

Hello Greg,

Thanks for all the work you and the stable team are doing on the
stable series. To me the above message is a little bit cryptic however
-- which bugs have been fixed, and what was their impact ? I know it
takes time to write down such information, sometimes called release
notes. But I think including this information with the announcements
of the stable releases would be a great service to the people reading
these announcements.

what do you include/omit?

But also remember that -stable releases are just a compilation of

That deals with how security bugs that are sent to <a href="mailto:security@kernel.org">security@kernel.org</a>
are handled, which is totally different from -stable releases, right?

&gt; As I&#039;m somewhere there is no web access, mind summarizing these if they

they&#039;re very relevant and rather long, you should take your time and read
them whenever you&#039;re back on the normal net. or you can do like RMS and
surf the web through email ;).

&gt; &gt; what is the disclosure policy used for commits fixing bugs with security
&gt; &gt; impact (both vanilla and -stable, especially if there&#039;s a difference)?
&gt; 
&gt; What is outlined in Documentation/SecurityBugs.

so it&#039;s full disclosure for both vanilla and -stable, there&#039;s no difference?
just because at the end of your mail you say:

&gt; &gt; how does it relate to what is declared in Documentation/SecurityBugs?
&gt; 
&gt; That deals with how security bugs that are sent to <a href="mailto:security@kernel.org">security@kernel.org</a>
&gt; are handled, which is totally different from -stable releases, right?

now are they totally different or not? ;)

in any case, you say the full disclosure policy applies. what does that mean
for you? does it mean omitting security impact information you know about
(not &#039;here is a working exploit&#039; but &#039;this is a buffer overflow&#039; or &#039;this
is an exploitable bug&#039;)? because such omissions have repeatedly occured for
the past many years (you&#039;ll find several examples pointed out at those LWN
URLs) and they&#039;re hard to reconcile with your declared disclosure policy.

&gt; &gt; what do you include/omit?
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I omit posting full &quot;and here is explicitly how to exploit
&gt; this problem&quot; notices as that is foolish.

do you also omit any of the usual security related words, such as, say,
&#039;buffer overflow&#039;, &#039;security&#039; when describing a bug? say, look at today&#039;s
2.6.25.11 and its single fix that doesn&#039;t say anything about &#039;security&#039;,
heck, not even its announcement does. do you think it&#039;s what constitutes
full disclosure? ;)

&gt; But also remember that -stable releases are just a compilation of
&gt; patches that developers have sent to the stable developers, we use the
&gt; original commit messages as published in the main kernel tree, except
&gt; where the patch differs, which is rare.

you at least add CVE IDs on occasion, mainline commits are even worse in
that regard.

&gt;  So it&#039;s not like these releases are any different than the main kernel
&gt; releases on descriptions of patches and issues surrounding them. 

yes, the real and more important problem is with the mainline development
itself, you&#039;re mostly suffering collateral damage, so to speak. but since
you&#039;re also part of that development process, you can&#039;t hide behind that.

so guys (meaning not only Greg but Andrew, Linus, et al.), when will you
publicly explain why you&#039;re covering up security impact of bugs? and even
more importantly, when will you change your policy or bring your process
in line with what you declared?

cheers,

We went through this discussion a couple of weeks ago, and I had 
absolutely zero interest in explaining it again.

I personally don&#039;t like embargoes. I don&#039;t think they work. That means 
that I want to fix things asap. But that also means that there is never a

i don&#039;t follow you here. you&#039;re making 4 statements essentially:

A. &#039;i want to fix bugs asap&#039;
B. &#039;i can let people know only when it&#039;s not an issue any more&#039;
C. &#039;there is no point in letting people know when it&#039;s not an issue any more&#039;
D. A implies B and/or C

let&#039;s see them one by one.

A: fine and even commendable.

B: that&#039;s part of the disclosure policy, so be it, although it raises
   the question of *when* a bug is no longer an issue. when the fix is
   in your git tree? in all/some affected vendor trees? in all affected
   linux trees in existence? or does it depend on when x % of the
   affected machines is running it? what&#039;s your criterion?

C: do you realize what you just said? effectively, &#039;there&#039;s no point
   in disclosure&#039;. that&#039;s diametrically opposite to what you previously
   argued for (rather vehemently, as vendor-sec readers surely remember).
   to remind yourself of your own words:

     <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/205" title="http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/205">http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/205</a>
     <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/363" title="http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/363">http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/363</a>
     <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/13/305" title="http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/13/305">http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/13/305</a>

   in any case, who decided this? you? did you ask anyone actually
   affected (vendors, users, whatnot)? in case you missed about two
   decades of security problems and their (mis)handling by proprietary
   vendors, this was the *exact* reason why they got shamed repeatedly
   in public (does bugtraq mean anything to you?) and why we have
   public security mailing lists and a whole industry nowadays.

D: this one is a non-sequitur, the timeline (or even willingness) of
   fixing bugs does not imply their disclosure policy. you can surely
   fix a bug independently of telling about it. so the question stays:
   why do you think not disclosing security impact info at all is good,
   and is what users want?

&gt; So I personally consider security bugs to be just &quot;normal bugs&quot;.

security bugs aren&#039;t just &#039;normal bugs&#039;, the more serious of them
allow to completely break the security model of the kernel. the world
at large has long ago decided that such bugs *are* special and there&#039;s
an entire industry dedicated to finding/fixing/exploiting/etc them,
not to mention academic research of the same. you can&#039;t ignore reality
like that, i&#039;m afraid.

&gt; I don&#039;t cover them up,

by &#039;cover up&#039; i meant that even when you know better, you quite
consciously do *not* report the security impact of said bugs - that&#039;s
the part called &#039;cover up&#039; because it&#039;s about the opposite of full
disclosure that you also advocated in the past. now you made it clear
that you don&#039;t actually (want to) practice it (i&#039;m not arguing with
that choice btw, just pointing out the inconsistency between your
declared words and actual actions).

&gt; but I also don&#039;t have any reason what-so-ever to think it&#039;s 
&gt; a good idea to track them and announce them as something special. 

see my comment about reality above. heck, even linux vendors do track
and announce them, it&#039;s part of the support they provide to paying
customers (and even non-paying users).

&gt; So there is no &quot;policy&quot;. Nor is it likely to change. 

obviously there *is* a policy, it&#039;s just not what you guys declared
earlier in Documentation/SecurityBugs. would you care to update it
or, more properly, remove it altogether as it currently says:

  Linux kernel developers take security very seriously.  As such, we&#039;d
  like to know when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  disclosed as quickly as possible.  Please report security bugs to the
  ^^^^^^^^^
  Linux kernel security team.

and what you said above about disclosure and treatment of security bugs
is the opposite of it. there is no reason for the kernel security list
to exist, basically (you already have lkml and bugzilla to discuss bugs,
which, according to you, security bugs are as well, there&#039;s no need for
special treatment).

cheers,
  PaX Team

PS: i do wonder however, how do you and others expect people to track the
quality of the development process if you apparently refuse to properly
account for security bugs? at this moment the Jeff Jones of the world are
smacking their head realizing the extent their statistics were flawed and
will no doubt have a field day with your statements.

Hi, so I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re new to the Linux kernel.  What you are
missing is while *Linus* is unwilling to play the disclosure game,
there are kernel developers (many of whom work for distributions, and
who *do* want some extra time to prepare a package for release to
their customers) who do.  So what Linus has expressed is his personal
opinion, and he is simply is not on any of the various mailing lists
that receive limited-disclosure information, such as the general
<a href="mailto:vendor-sec@lst.de">vendor-sec@lst.de</a> mailing list, or the <a href="mailto:security@kernel.org">security@kernel.org</a> list
mentioned in Documentation/SecurityBugs.

Both vendor-sec and <a href="mailto:security@kernel.org">security@kernel.org</a> are not formal organizations,
so they can not sign NDAs, but they will honor non disclosure
requests, and the subscription list for both lists is carefully
controlled.

People like Linus who have a strong, principled stand for Full
Disclosure simply choose not to request to be placed on those mailing
lists.  And if Linus finds out about a security bug, he will fix it
and check it into the public git repository right away.  But he&#039;s very
honest in telling you that is what he will do --- so you can choose
whether or not to include him in any disclosures that you might choose
to make.

The arguments about whether or not Full Disclosure is a good idea or
not, and whether or not the &quot;black hat&quot; and &quot;grey hat&quot; and &quot;white hat&quot;
security research firms are unalloyed forces for good, or whether they
have downsides (and some might say very serious downsides) have been
arguments that I have personally witnessed for over two decades
(Speaking as someone who helped to dissect the Robert T. Morris
Internet Worm in 1988, led the Kerberos development team at MIT for
many years, and chaired the IP SEC Working Group for the IETF, I have
more than my fair share of experience).  It is clear that we&#039;re not
going settle this debate now, and certainly not on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List.

Suffice it to say, though, that there are people whose views on these
matters span the entire gamut, and I know many reasonable people who
hold very different positions along the entire continuum --- and this
is true both in the Internet community at large, and in the Linux
Kernel development community specifically.

Btw, and you may not like this, since you are so focused on security, one 
reason I refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that I think 
it glorifies - and thus encourages - the wrong behavior.

It makes &quot;heroes&quot; out of security people, as if the people who don&#039;t just 
fix normal bugs aren&#039;t as important.

In fact, all the boring normal bugs are _way_ more important, just because 
there&#039;s a lot more of them. I don&#039;t think some spectacular security hole 
should be glorified or cared about as being any more &quot;special&quot; than a 
random spectacular crash due to bad locking.

Security people are often the black-and-white kind of people that I can&#039;t 
stand. I think the OpenBSD crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys, in 
that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the 
point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them.

To me, security is important. But it&#039;s no less important than everything 
*else* that is also important!

if you worry about script kiddies (btw, for someone not bothering with
the whole security circus you surely do use their terms as bogeymen
to rationalize your stand) triggering or even exploiting local kernel
bugs then you imply that they&#039;re already local users on that box and
that in turn means they have already been having fun all that time.
just remember how Andrew put it:

  But there are so many ways to cripple a Linux box once you have
  local access. (<a href="/web/20080719130436/http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/379" title="http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/379">http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/12/379</a>)

in other words, try a better argument, possibly without bogeymen.

next, what about, say, sysadmins	, bigger and smaller distro maintainers,
etc trying to figure out whether they need to backport a given fix or
not? do you think you&#039;re helping them too?

on a sidenote, what do you know about script kiddies? how do you think
they operate? do you think they&#039;re watching a real-time rss from kernel.org
to catch the latest and greatest security fixes? do you think they can
write PoC or actual exploit code based on commits?

last but not least, if i submitted a security fix with the commit message
actually saying that it fixes a security problem, would you remove that
information before committing? based on the above that sounds as a &#039;yes&#039;,
but i&#039;d like to have that explicitly on the record.

&gt; &gt; see my comment about reality above. heck, even linux vendors do track

people consider and backport patches that come to their attention,
which in turn happens by their scanning the changes, following various
threads of discussions (both public and private, depending on what they
have access to), etc. if you withhold security impact information then
you&#039;re skewing their &#039;big issue&#039; detector as well, further reducing
*their* users&#039; security.

&gt; That&#039;s why I don&#039;t do reporting - it almost inevitably leads to embargoes.

i don&#039;t see you embargo normal bug fixes, why would you embargo security
bug fixes? they&#039;re just normal bugs, aren&#039;t they?

&gt; So as far as I&#039;m concerned, &quot;disclosing&quot; is the fixing of the bug. It&#039;s 
&gt; the &quot;look at the source&quot; approach.

when you fix a bug, the commit describes what it fixes without omitting
anything relevant. when you fix a security bug, its commit doesn&#039;t say
what it fixes (not even that it&#039;s a security fix, never mind actual
impact information), that is, you omit relevant information (based on
some ill-conceived argument that i deconstructed at the beginning). in
other words, you&#039;re *not* treating security bugs as normal bugs. for
all intents and purposes, you cover them up. i *wish* you did treat
them as normal bugs however.

You know what - when nobody does embargoes, I&#039;ll consider your argument to

In the meantime, I&#039;m not in the least interested in your idiotic

Exactly. I don&#039;t embargo them. I refuse to have anything to even _do_ with 
organizations like vendor-sec that I think is a corrupt cluster-fuck of 
people who just want to cover their own ass.

They&#039;re just normal bugs.

But that also doesn&#039;t mean that I see any reason to make it obvious what 
to do to trigger them, and cause problems at universities and such. So I 
don&#039;t do &quot;here&#039;s how to exploit it&quot; commit logs, for example.

(If you haven&#039;t been at a univerisity, you don&#039;t know how many smart young 
people want to &quot;try it to see&quot;. And if you have been there, and don&#039;t

expertise and time it takes to determine that. but what happens when
you do figure out the security relevance of a bug during bug submission
(say, it goes directly to <a href="mailto:security@kernel.org">security@kernel.org</a> with a PoC to trigger it)
or while working out the fix or you see that it falls into an well-known
exploitable bug class? you have the information yet you still make no

The issue is that I think it&#039;s then _misleading_ to mark that kind of 
commit specially, when I actually believe that it&#039;s in the minority.

If people think that they are safer for only applying (or upgrading to) 
certain patches that are marked as being security-specific, they are 
missing all the ones that weren&#039;t marked as such. Making them even 
_believe_ that the magic security marking is meaningful is simply a lie. 
It&#039;s not going to be.

So why would I add some marking that I most emphatically do not believe in 
myself, and think is just mostly security theater?

I generally do not remove peoples changelog entries, although I _will_ 
do even that if I think it&#039;s just too much of an actual exploit 
description (of course - the patch itself can make the exploit fairly 
clear). So you&#039;ll find CVE entries etc in the logs if you look.

But I do hope that anybody who looks for them is _aware_ that it&#039;s just a 
small minority of possible problems.

Don&#039;t get me wrong - I&#039;m not saying that security bugs are _common_, but 
especially some local DoS thing for a specific driver or filesystem or 
whatever can be a big security problem for _somebody_.

the end). anything you omit will skew their decision making process (in

you should check out the last few -stable releases then and see how
the announcement doesn&#039;t ever mention the word &#039;security&#039; while fixing
security bugs (see my analysis at <a href="/web/20080719130436/http://lwn.net/Articles/288473/" title="http://lwn.net/Articles/288473/">http://lwn.net/Articles/288473/</a>).

unless one digs into the actual commits and determines what&#039;s going on,
it&#039;s easy to make a bad judgement call even for -stable. you know, there
are places that can&#039;t just reboot into a new kernel every week for no
reason (Microsoft has patch Tuesday once a month only).

also what about people running older kernels, outside of -stable focus?
do you determine how far back a fix should be applied? i don&#039;t think so,
but people maintaining older series will do that, provided they get a hint.

in other words, it&#039;s all the more reason to have the commit say it&#039;s
fixing a security issue.

&gt; I&#039;m just saying that why mark things, when the marking have no meaning? 
&gt; People who believe in them are just _wrong_.

what is wrong in particular? when you know that you&#039;re about to commit a
patch that fixes a security bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?
in what way will people reading that commit be misled? they will see it&#039;s
fixing a security bug and they can prioritize it for whatever processes they
have for backports, analysis, etc. if they don&#039;t see such marks, they will
have to do a whole lot more work (effectively duplicating your own and even
each other&#039;s efforts) to figure out the same. why not save them time and
tell them directly what you already know?

You have two cases:

   People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that

 - People don&#039;t think it matters

It&#039;s pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs

&gt; &gt; you should check out the last few -stable releases then and see how

&gt; &gt; security bugs
&gt; 
&gt; Umm. What part of &quot;they are just normal bugs&quot; did you have issues with?

oh, we&#039;re back to that. i told you that already, here it is again (just
quoting myself back):

  when you fix a bug, the commit describes what it fixes without omitting
  anything relevant. when you fix a security bug, its commit doesn&#039;t say
  what it fixes (not even that it&#039;s a security fix, never mind actual
  impact information), that is, you omit relevant information (based on
  some ill-conceived argument that i deconstructed at the beginning). in
  other words, you&#039;re *not* treating security bugs as normal bugs. for
  all intents and purposes, you cover them up. i *wish* you did treat
  them as normal bugs however.

we went through this and you yourself said that security bugs are *not*
treated as normal bugs because you do omit relevant information from such
commits whereas you do *not* omit relevant information from normal commits.
for security bugs the fact that they fix a security issue is relevant
information.

&gt; I expressly told you that security bugs should not be marked as such, 
&gt; because bugs are bugs. 

repeating the same thing doesn&#039;t make the self-contradiction above go
away. bugs are properly described in the commits, security bugs aren&#039;t
(you said so yourself), therefore they can&#039;t be of the same category.

what you&#039;re still trying to justify is why you are covering up security
bugs, plain and simple.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#039;m just saying that why mark things, when the marking have no meaning? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; People who believe in them are just _wrong_.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; what is wrong in particular?
&gt; 
&gt; You have two cases:
&gt; 
&gt;  - people think the marking is somehow trustworthy.
&gt; 
&gt;    People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that 
&gt;    unmarked bugfixes are &quot;less important&quot;. They aren&#039;t.

why would people think that unmarked bugfixes are less important? who are
you to make that judgement for them anyway? the importance of bugs is
*orthogonal* to their classification (security, etc). it&#039;s up to the people
and their decision making processes to deal with that. all you should do
is help them by not withholding relevant information. in case it wasn&#039;t
clear, i&#039;m not talking about just about any person like my grandma, but
people whose work involves following kernel development, who can use all
the extra information to make judgement calls about what to prioritize.
they&#039;re certainly not dumb and would not think that only commits marked
as such are security related.

&gt;  - People don&#039;t think it matters
&gt; 
&gt;    People are right, and the marking is pointless.

you have yet to prove why it&#039;s pointless. the above attempt failed to do so.

&gt; In either case it&#039;s just stupid to mark them. I don&#039;t want to do it, 
&gt; because I don&#039;t want to perpetuate the myth of &quot;security fixes&quot; as a 
&gt; separate thing from &quot;plain regular bug fixes&quot;.

it&#039;s not a myth, it&#039;s called reality. a bugfix that gets my pc speaker beep
again is very different from a fix that stops the tcp/ip stack sending out
random kernel memory to the net (just made them up, before anyone starts
looking). you&#039;re desperately trying to ignore the importance of security
bugs but you&#039;re failing. the world has decided that security bugs *are*
important and deserve special attention. and it&#039;s not as if you had to do
any extra work, you already have the information, you should just not
*withhold* it.

&gt; They&#039;re all fixes. They&#039;re all important. As are new features, for that 
&gt; matter.

&#039;importance&#039; is not a big grey goo that applies equally to all fixes. you
want to make it appear so, but that doesn&#039;t make it so.

&gt; &gt; when you know that you&#039;re about to commit a patch that fixes a security 
&gt; &gt; bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?
&gt; 
&gt; It&#039;s pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs 
&gt; aren&#039;t potential security fixes.

why does it make people think that? did you ask them? what if you told them
as i suggested (and you conveniently skipped) what to expect? do you think
people dealing with kernel maintenance at companies, distros, etc are that
dumb?

You think that explicitly pointing something out as a security issue is 
really important, so you think it&#039;s always &quot;relevant&quot;. And I take mostly 
the opposite view. I think pointing it out is actually likely to be 
counter-productive.

For example, the way I prefer to work is to have people send me and the 
kernel list a patch for a fix, and then in the very next email send (in 
private) an example exploit of the problem to the security mailing list 
(and that one goes to the private security list just because we don&#039;t want 
all the people at universities rushing in to test it). THAT is how things 
should work.

Should I document the exploit in the commit message? Hell no.  It&#039;s 
private for a reason, even if it&#039;s real information. It was real 
information for the developers to explain why a patch is needed, but once 
explained, it shouldn&#039;t be spread around unnecessarily.

&gt; It&#039;s very helpful and relevant when we&#039;re trying to chase

you&#039;re wrong on that however. it is important for many people to able
to perform the same verification that you do. just imagine the backports
to versions that you don&#039;t do yourselves. but organizing the dissemination
of such code is not what i&#039;ve been talking about all this time.
 
&gt; You think that explicitly pointing something out as a security issue is

don&#039;t mistake my presence in this thread as me, an invidual arguing for his
own benefit. i already know when you fix security bugs, even when you don&#039;t
sometimes. so when i say something is relevant, it&#039;s not merely my opinion,
it&#039;s what most people dealing with security issues (both inside and outside
the linux universe) think. with that said, let&#039;s move on:

&gt; And I take mostly the opposite view. I think pointing it out is

fine with me, i wasn&#039;t talking about that at all though ;).

&gt; Should I document the exploit in the commit message? Hell no.

fully understood and agreed. never even asked for that.

&gt;  It&#039;s private for a reason, even if it&#039;s real information. It was real
&gt; information for the developers to explain why a patch is needed, but
&gt; once explained, it shouldn&#039;t be spread around unnecessarily. 

agreed (with the same additonal thoughts as above on the trigger code).

ok, so let&#039;s make it simpler for everyone to understand what is at issue
here. it seems that we agree that there&#039;re several levels of information
that exist when it comes to security bugs and we don&#039;t understand each
other as to what should go into a commit and what should stay out. let
me propose a categorization and you tell me what you think you would be
willing to put into a commit (feel free to break them up further if that&#039;s
what it takes).

1. simple words/phrases that one can grep for (mentally or automated)
   examples: &#039;security&#039;, &#039;exploitable&#039;, &#039;DoS&#039;, &#039;buffer overflow&#039;, etc

2. simple sentence describing roughly what kind of security bug it is
   example: fix exploitable null function pointer dereference in foo.

3. sample code able to trigger the bug and cause an oops/crash but not
   privilege elevation, no effort made to be &#039;weapons grade&#039; (does not
   support several archs, kernel versions, etc)

4. proof-of-concept exploit that triggers the bug, and demonstrates its
   effect (say privilege elevation) with manual tweaking (say, you look
   up an address in System.map and the like, but nothing automated)

5. full blown weaponized exploit

i believe 3-5 are definitely not commit message material. 1 or 2 are.
5 should never be published or disseminated, 3 and 4 may be distributed
to interested parties.

Oh, so now you&#039;re suddenly fine with not doing &quot;full disclosure&quot;?

Just a few emails ago you berated me for not doing full disclosure, but 
now you&#039;re saying it is fine?

Can you now admit that it&#039;s a gray line, and that we just have very 
different opinions of where the line is drawn?

&gt; 1. simple words/phrases that one can grep for (mentally or automated)
&gt;    examples: &#039;security&#039;, &#039;exploitable&#039;, &#039;DoS&#039;, &#039;buffer overflow&#039;, etc

I literally draw the line at anything that is simply greppable for. If 
it&#039;s not a very public security issue already, I don&#039;t want a simple &quot;git 
log + grep&quot; to help find it.

That said, I don&#039;t _plan_ messages or obfuscate them, so &quot;overflow&quot; might 
well be part of the message just because it simply describes the fix. So 
I&#039;m not claiming that the messages can never help somebody pinpoint 
interesting commits to look at, I&#039;m just also not at all interested in 
doing so reliably.

&gt; i believe 3-5 are definitely not commit message material. 1 or 2 are.
&gt; 5 should never be published or disseminated, 3 and 4 may be distributed
&gt; to interested parties.

And I believe you now at least understand the difference. I draw the line 
between 0 and 1, where 0 is &quot;explain the fix&quot; - which is something that 
any - and every - commit message should do.

&gt; For all the above: no. And this is the point of divergence.
&gt; For you, as a person who &quot;writes software&quot;, every bug is equivalent. You  
&gt; need to resolve problems, not classify them.
&gt;
&gt; However, as I previously explained [http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/15/654],  
&gt; security issues are identified and communicated through what can be a  
&gt; long and complicated (due to DNAs, etc.) process. If it culminates at  
&gt; implementation, without proper information forwarding from the  
&gt; development team, it will never reach the &quot;upper layers&quot; -- vendors,  
&gt; distributors, end users, et al.

Look if you want this, pay $$$ to a distribution and get their
supported distribution.  It costs time and effort to classify bugs as
security related (or not), and the people who care about this the most
also want to freeze a kernel version to simplify their application
testing, *but* get new drivers and bus support code back-ported so
they can use the latest hardware (while still keeping their
applications and 3rd party proprietary kernel modules from Nvidia and
Vertias stable and working) *and* they want the latest security fixes
(and only security fixes, since other fixes might destablize their
application).  People who want this can get it, today.  Just pick up
the phone and give a call to your favoriate enterprise Linux
distribution.  It will cost you money, but hey, the people who want
this sort of thing typically are willing to pay for the service.

I&#039;ll note that trying to classify bugs as being &quot;security-related&quot; at
the kernel.org level often doesn&#039;t help the distro&#039;s, since many of
these bugs won&#039;t even apply to whatever version of the kernel the
distro&#039;s snapshotted 9-18 months ago.  So if the distro snapshotted
2.6.18 in Fall 2006, and their next snapshot will be sometime two
years later in the fall of this year, they will have no use for some
potential local denial of service attack that was introduced by
accident in 2.6.24-rc3, and fixed in 2.6.25-rc1.  It just doesn&#039;t
matter to them.

So basically, if there are enough kernel.org users who care, they can
pay someone to classify and issue CVE numbers for each and every
potential &quot;security bug&quot; that might appear and then disappear.  Or
they can volunteer and do it themselves.  Of course, this will provide
aid and comfort to Microsoft-shills masquerading as analysts who
misuse CVE numbers to generate reports &quot;proving&quot; that Microsoft is
more secure (because they don&#039;t do their development in the open, so
issues that appear and disappear in development snapshots don&#039;t get
CVE numbers assigned), but hopefully most users are sophsitcated
enough not to get taken in by that kind of bogus study.  :-)

The one thing which is really pointless to do is to ask kernel
developers to do all of this classification work to get CVE numbers,
etc., for free.  In free software, people do what they (or their
company) deem to be valuable for them.  Flaming and complaining that
the kernel git logs aren&#039;t providing free marketing for PaX/grsecurity
isn&#039;t going to do much good.

That is based on lots and lots of assumptions that are just not true.
Ted Tso, Stephen Smalley and I are all recognized as security experts
and we can&#039;t even agree on whether sockets are objects or not, much
less what constitutes a security bug and even less what is likely to
be a security bug. Goodness, there are some of us who would argue
that since DNS is itself a security bug it is just not possible for
DNS to have a security bug, as an example.

Err, no, in the kernel environment a real security flaw is likely to
be pretty subtle.

You do not hesitate in categorizing yourself as something as obscure

I would suggest you maintain your own kernel version, since you&#039;re so 
obviously more competent at it than we are. 

Then, when you inevitably show your superiority, people will start using 
your version of the kernel. That&#039;s the point of open source, after all. It 
keeps us all honest - at any point, we can be overtaken by somebody 
better.

I&#039;ve actually been waiting for this moment for over fifteen years now: 
finding that person who can take over so that I don&#039;t have to bother any 
more. I&#039;ll continue to do my own maintenance in parallel while you get up 
to speed, but I expect that everybody will have dropped my feeble efforts 
soon enough, so you can probably just ignore that. 

Thanks,

Raising an honest question and following with one, not less sincere,

How can I expect one to treat the unknown? If you are not aware of it, 
you do nothing. Whenever a software organization is informed of a 
problem in some product of their responsibility, they act upon it. On 
the contrary, no, I don&#039;t expect any magic from you. Thanks for

Wrong. This is not &quot;media circus&quot;.
Whoever reads this thread with the basic understanding of software 
development procedures, the reality of information security and with 
legit judgment will clearly understand what you are doing and what 
&quot;pageexec&quot; and I claim for. Further, I claim for decency from your part.

All I ask for is to receive the &quot;There are updates available.&quot; message 
as soon as one security problem is reported, understood and treated by 
your development part. And that is, the sooner possible, if you please.
Plus, if one bothers, to be able to know the exact location of this bug 
and its characteristics.

However, for these to happen, we need your collaboration. Or, with two 
words, your responsibility.

Well, some people keep it secret and track it on vendor-sec or similar, 
hidden from us.

But then when they are ready to announce it, they want our help to glorify 
their corrupt process when they finally deign to let us know. And that 
really irritates me.

Umm. You&#039;re talking to _entirely_ the wrong person.

The people who want to track security issues don&#039;t run my development 
kernels. They usually don&#039;t even run the _stable_ kernels. They tend to 
run the kernels from some commercial distribution, and usually one that is 
more than six months old as far as I - and other kernel developers - are 
concerned.

IOW, when we fix security issues, it&#039;s simply not even appropriate or 
relevant to you. More importantly, when we fix them, your vendor probably 
won&#039;t have the fix for at least another week or two in most cases anyway.

So ask yourself - what would happen if I actually made a big deal out of 
every bug we find that could possibly be a security issue. HONESTLY now!

We&#039;d basically be announcing a bug that (a) may not be relevant to you, 
but (b) _if_ it is relevant to you, you almost certainly won&#039;t actually 
have fixed packages until a week or two later available to you!

Do you see?

I would not actually be helping you. I&#039;d be helping the people you want to 
protect against!

  <div class="content"><p>53 is the destination port for DNS queries.  User-space unprivileged tasks cannot generally bind "privileged" ports--that is, port numbers under 1024.  Unprivileged tasks can make DNS queries directly--they don't need a local privileged daemon to make them on their behalf.  So, in a sense, we've been using arbitrary source ports for awhile, since all these unprivileged tasks have been binding arbitrary ports above 1023 for the source port of their requests.  (Note that I said "arbitrary," not "random.")</p>
<p>One issue is that many resolvers use a single port for all requests, making it easy to forge replies to a client that'll make multiple requests.  That is, it binds the port once saying "Just give me an arbitrary port number", and it'll send multiple requests from that same port.  If you've managed to see one request go out from a client, you know future requests will go out via the same port.  This is a real problem for long-lived clients.  If you run a local DNS caching server then every program on your machine could be affected.</p>
<p>The change apparently is to  bind to a different port for each request, and to explicitly randomize the port number rather than rely on the arbitrary port numbers handed out by the OS.  </p>
<p>Note that you can arrange to find out what port number a client is sending requests on by tricking it into sending a DNS server you control a request.  (Kaminsky's DNS checker works on this principle.)  This could be through a 1 pixel GIF on a webpage or other such trickery.  If whatever resolver sends the request to your hacked DNS server is vulnerable to this hole, then you know what port it's sending requests out on and now have ammunition for attacking it.  If it's a caching DNS server at an ISP, then can start flooding it with queries and bogus responses and with any luck your bogus responses take hold.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I don't know what Dan Kaminsky found.  The above is just speculation that I've been able to piece together following discussions around various sites. </p>

  <div class="content"><p>If this hole is truly inherent in the DNS protocol itself, and has survived this long, it's likely very subtle.  Without knowing what the bug is, how do I know that this is a complete fix?  It might solve one case but not another.  Or, it might only mitigate the problem without solving it.</p>
<p>The lack of disclosure about the exact nature of the hole, coupled with the heads up that there IS definitely at least one hole and it's in a particular area means that someone might rush in there and find a different, related hole.  It's really an arms race.  Why not at least arm the other security experts as well as you can?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>It is important to point out which bugs are security vulnerabilities.<br />
If it its just a minor bug in a software that make it crash, or something appear out of place, then it don't not so important for me to get a new version.<br />
If it is a security vulnerability then it is very important for me to get the update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Not mentioning security vulnerabilities is something I would expect from Microsoft and other proprietary vendors who want to avoid bad publicity and falsely tricking their users into a false sense of security.<br />
With open source software, I expect the developers to me honest, straight and transparent with me about security vulnerabilities.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Well, if your software is running on a box inside a closed network, interacting with nothing but other boxes inside that closed network, then maybe a bug that makes it crash or something appear out of place is much more important than a security fix.</p>
<p>That's the whole point. Security fixes are just as important as any other fix, because importance is dependent on the specifics of where and how the software is being used.</p>

&gt; i want to make a presentation to introduce OpenBSD into the public of my<br />

&gt; Ideas?</p>
<p>It's from obsd mailing list so I think that Linus is right :D.<br />
Btw. when we talk about security, bugs etc:</p>
<p>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf this command could hang machine with obsd, so it looks like focusing on some bugs and ignoring other things is not so good...</p>

<p>What where the "more critical" issues?</p>
<p>If this bug <em>did</em> exist (I don't know, but let's just assume it did) it isn't much of a security threat.  Yeah, the root user (or anyone able to sudo pfctl) can crash the machine.  The <em>root</em> user.  Big deal!  </p>
<p>Sure, it's a bug and it must be fixed, but a SECURITY issue?  Give me a break.</p>

If having the OpenBSD attitude towards bugs makes you a masturbating monkey, Linus can borrow my baboon porn and banana lube any time. OOOOOh OOOOOOh OOOOOh!</p>
