and "<a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/navigating-the-new-digital-divide-retail.html?id=us:2el:3pr:diginf15:awa:retail:051515">digital interactions are expected to influence 64 cents of every dollar spent in retail stores by the end of 2015</a>. However, behind these impressive numbers, the
payment landscape is quickly changing, and new challenges are appearing. For
instance, the <a
href="http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">average
				   shopping cart abandonment rate is 69% across all devices</a>,
											      and even higher on
mobile. A variety of factors are limiting the potential of ecommerce, from
the high level fraud related to credit card payments, to the fragmentation of payment solutions available on the Web but not
available on all merchant sites or on all devices. </p>
<p>At the same time, there is a growing interest from businesses to find
alternatives to business models based on advertisement. These alternatives
include e.g. in-app payments, or micropayments that are today challenging due
to a variety of factors such as heterogeneity and number of payment options to
support, or the inability for existing payment systems to cope with very small
payments. </p>
<p>In order to address these issues, and for greater interoperability in the
area of payments, the vision behind this activity is to enable: 1) Users to choose their preferred payment solutions across all their
    devices; 2) Merchants to transparently support a growing number of payment solutions; 3) Developers to monetize applications more easily; 4) New payment solution providers to enter the market more easily with innovative solutions and payment schemes; 5) Society to decrease online fraud; 6) New payment models such as micropayments &amp; paywalls to take-off.</p>

			      <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security ("WebAppSec") Working Group</a>, which is developing standards to ensure that Web applications are delivered as intended, free from spoofing, injection, and eavesdropping.</li>
			      <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/12/web-authentication-charter.html">Web Authentication
