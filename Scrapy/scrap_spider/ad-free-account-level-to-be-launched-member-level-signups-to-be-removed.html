<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2008/12/16/ad-free-account-level-to-be-launched-member-level-signups-to-be-removed/'>Ad Free account level to be launched, Member level signups to be removed</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 15 December 2008</p>
<p>As reported recently in our newsletter, we'll shortly be disabling new
Member level signups, and replacing Member with a new service level
called Ad Free.</p>

<p>Over the past 7 years, FastMail has had 4 different service levels for
individual accounts: <strong>Guest</strong> (free), <strong>Member</strong> (one-time $14.95),
<strong>Full</strong> ($19.95/year) and <strong>Enhanced</strong> ($39.95/year). As market
conditions have changed, we've updated the features offered by each
level to stay competitive while remaining profitable so we can continue
to offer our service for the long term.</p>

<p>Recent data we've collected has shown that the Member level is not being
used very much. However we did identify a market for a low priced, small
storage, ad-free account. Because of that, <strong>from the start of 2009 we
will be removing the ability to signup for new "Member" accounts, and
replacing it with a new level called "Ad Free"</strong> (if you have an
existing Member level account, or Member level fallback, don't worry,
see below).</p>

<p>The main details of the new level are:</p>

<ul>
<li>US$4.95/year</li>
<li>No ads in the web interface</li>
<li>All access protocols - IMAP/POP/SMTP/LDAP/Jabber</li>
<li>30M email storage, 2M file storage</li>
<li>160M bandwidth/month</li>
</ul>

<p>The account level is already available on our beta server
(<a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/beta/">http://www.fastmail.fm/beta/</a>), so if you want to upgrade an existing
account or signup a new account you can do so there. Any account you do
signup/upgrade there will be fully useable on the beta and also the
regular production server as well, we just don't have layout space to
list it until the Member level is closed.</p>

<p>If you have been thinking of getting a Member level account, then you
should do so before 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Guest accounts</strong>: A number of people have asked if we're getting rid
of Guest level accounts. Guest level accounts are <strong>not</strong> being removed
or changed in any way and will continue to operate exactly as they are.</p>

<p><strong>Existing Member/Member "fallback" users:</strong> We're not making any
changes to existing users, the only change is that from 2009, you won't
be able to signup a new Member level account. Users with existing Member
level accounts will stay exactly as they are. If you have an existing
Full/Enhanced account that has a Member level "fallback", then that will
also stay exactly the same, and if you don't renew, your account will
become a Member level account.</p>
