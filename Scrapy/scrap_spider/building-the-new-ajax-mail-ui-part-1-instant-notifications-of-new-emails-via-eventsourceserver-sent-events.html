<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  8 January 2012</p>
<p>With the release of the <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/2011/12/23/new-webmail-user-interface-being-tested-on-beta-server/">new AJAX user interface into testing on the
Fastmail beta
server</a>,
we decided that it might be interesting to talk about the technology
that has gone into making the new interface work. This post is the first
of a series of technical posts we plan to do over the next few months,
documenting some of the interesting work and technologies we've used to
power the new interface. Regular users can skip these posts, but we hope
technical users find them interesting.</p>

<p>We're starting the series by looking at how we push instant
notifications of new email from the server to the web application
running in your browser. The communication mechanism we are using is the
native <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/">eventsource/server-sent
events</a> object. Our reasons for
choosing this were threefold:</p>

<ol>
<li>It has slightly broader browser support than websockets
(<a href="http://caniuse.com/eventsource">eventsource</a> vs
<a href="http://caniuse.com/websockets">websockets</a>)</li>
<li>We already had a well defined JSON RPC API, using XmlHttpRequest
objects to request data from the server, so the only requirement we
had was for notifications about new data, which is exactly what
eventsource was designed for</li>
<li>For browsers that don't support a native eventsource object, we
could fallback to emulating it closely enough without too much extra
code (more below), so we need only maintain one solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>We're using native eventsource support in Opera 11+, Chrome 6+, Safari
5+ and Firefox 6+. For older Firefox versions, the native object is
simulated using an XmlHttpRequest object; Firefox allows you to read
data as it is streaming. Internet Explorer unfortunately doesn't, and
whilst there are ways of doing push using script tags in a continually
loading iframe, they felt hacky and less robust, so we just went with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">long polling
solution</a>
there for now. It uses the same code as the older-Firefox eventsource
simulation object, the only difference is that the server has to close
the connection after each event is pused; the client then reestablishes
a new connection immediately. The effect is the same, it's just a little
less efficient.</p>

<p>Once you have an eventsource object, be it native or simulated, using it
for push notifications in the browser is easy; just point it at the
right URL, then wait for events to be fired on the object as data is
pushed. In the case of mail, we just send a 'something has changed'
notification. Whenever a new notification arrives, we invalidate the
cache and refresh the currently displayed view, fetching the new email.</p>

<p>On the server side, the event push implementation had a few requirements
and a few quirks to work with our existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Because eventsource connections are long lived, we need to use a system
that can scale to a potentially very large number of simultaneous open
connections. We already use <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> on our front end
servers for http, imap and pop proxying. nginx uses a small process pool
with a non-blocking event model and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll">epoll</a> on Linux, so it can scale to
a very large number of simultaneous connections. We regularly see over
30,000 simultaneous http, imap and pop connections to a frontend machine
(mostly SSL connections), with less than 1/10th of total CPU being used.</p>

<p>However, with a large number of client connections to nginx, we'd still
have to proxy them to some backend process that could handle the large
number of simultaneous connections. Fortunately, there is an alternative
event based approach.</p>

<p>After a little bit of searching, we found a <a href="https://github.com/wandenberg/nginx-push-stream-module/">third party push stream
module</a> for
nginx that was nearly compatible with the W3C eventsource specification.
We contacted the author, and thankfully he was willing to make the
changes required to make it fully compatible with the eventsource spec
and incorporate those changes back into the master version. Thanks
<a href="http://br.linkedin.com/pub/wandenberg-peixoto/8/82a/525">Wandenberg
Peixoto</a>!</p>

<p>Rather than proxying a connection, the module accepts a connection,
holds it open, and connects it to an internal subscriber "channel". You
can then use POST requests to the matching publisher URL channel to send
messages to the subscriber, and the messages will be sent to the client
over the open connection.</p>

<p>This means you don't have to hold lots of internal network proxy
connections open and deal with that scaling, instead you just have to
send POST requests to nginx when an "event" occurs. This is done via a
backend process that listens for events from cyrus (our IMAP server),
such as when new emails are delivered to a mailbox, and (longer term)
when any change is made to a mailbox.</p>

<p>Two other small issues also need to be dealt with. First is that only
logged in users should be able to connect to an eventsource channel, and
second is that we have two separate frontend servers and clients connect
randomly to one of the other because each hostname resolves to two IP
addresses, so the backend needs to send POST requests to the correct
frontend nginx server the user is connected to.</p>

<p>We do the first by accepting the client connection, proxying to a
backend mod_perl server which does the standard session and cookie
authentication, and then use nginx's internal <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/X-accel">X-Accel-Redirect
mechanism</a> to do an internal redirect
that hooks the connection to the correct subscriber channel. For the
second, we add a "X-Frontend" header to each proxied request, so that
the mod_perl backend knows which server the client is connected to.</p>

<p>The stripped down version of the nginx configuration looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    # clients connect to this URL to receive events
    location ^~ /events/ {
      # proxy to backend, it'll do authentication and X-Accel-Redirect
      # to /sub/ if user is authenticated, or return error otherwise
      proxy_set_header   X-Frontend   frontend1;
      proxy_pass         http://backend/events/;
    }
    location ^~ /subchannel/ {
      internal;
      push_stream_subscriber;
      push_stream_eventsource_support on;
      push_stream_content_type "text/event-stream; charset=utf-8";
    }
    # location we POST to from backend to push events to subscribers
    location ^~ /pubchannel/ {
      push_stream_publisher;
      # prevent anybody but us from publishing
      allow   10.0.0.0/8;
      deny    all;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the whole process together, the steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client connects to https://example.com/events/</li>
<li>Request is proxied to a mod_perl server</li>
<li>The mod_perl server does the usual session and user authentication</li>
<li>If not successful, an error is returned, otherwise we continue</li>
<li>The mod_perl server generates a channel number based on the user
and session key</li>
<li>It then sends a POST to the nginx process (picking the right one
based on the X-Frontend header) to create a new channel</li>
<li>It then returns an X-Accel-Redirect response to nginx which tells
nginx to internally redirect and connect the client to the
subscriber channel</li>
<li>It then contacts an event pusher daemon on the users backend IMAP
server to let it know that the user is now waiting for events. It
tells the daemon the user, the channel id, and the frontend server.
After doing that, the mod_perl request is complete and the process
is free to service other requests</li>
<li>On the backend IMAP server, the pusher daemon now waits for events
from cyrus, and filters out events for that user</li>
<li>When an event is received, it sends a POST request to the frontend
server to push the event over the eventsource connection to the
client</li>
<li>One of the things the nginx module returns in response to the PUSH
request is a "number of active subscribers" value. This should be 1,
but if it drops to 0, we know that the client has dropped its
connection, so at that point we don't need to monitor or push any
more events for that channel, and internally cleanup so we don't
push any more events for that user and channel. The nginx push
stream module automatically does this on the frontend as well.</li>
<li>If a client drops a connection and re-connects (in the same login
session), it'll get the same channel id. This avoids potentially
creating lots of channels</li>
</ol>

<p>In the future, we will be pushing events when any mailbox changes are
made, not just a new email delivery (e.g. change made in an IMAP client,
a mobile client, or another web login session). We don't currently do
this because we need to filter out notifications due to actions made by
the same client; since it already knows about these, invalidating the
cached would be very inefficient.</p>

<p>In general this all works as expected in all supported browsers and is
really very easy to use. We have however come across a few issues to do
with re-establishing lost connections. For example, when the computer
goes to sleep then wakes up, the connection will have probably been
lost. Opera has a bug in that it doesn't realise this and keeps showing
that the connection is OPEN (in readyState 1).</p>

<p>We've also found a potential related issue with the spec itself: "Any
other HTTP response code not listed here, and any network error that
prevents the HTTP connection from being established in the first place
(e.g. DNS errors), must cause the user agent to fail the connection".
This means that if you lose internet connection (for example pass
through a tunnel on the train), the eventsource will try to reconnect,
find there's no network and fail permanently. It will not make any
further attempts to connect to the server once a network connection is
found again. This same problem can cause a race condition when waking a
computer from sleep as it often takes a few seconds to re-establish the
internet connection. If the browser tries to re-establish the
eventsource connection before the network is up, it will therefore
permanently fail.</p>

<p>This spec problem can be worked around by observing the error event. If
the readyState property is now CLOSED (in readyState 2), we set a 30
second timeout. When this fires, we create a new eventsource object to
replace the old one (you can't reuse them) which will then try
connecting again; essentially this is manually recreating the reconnect
behaviour.</p>

<p>The Opera bug in not detecting it's lost a connection after waking from
sleep can be fixed by detecting when the computer has been asleep and
manually re-establishing the connection, even if it's apparently open.
To do this, we set a timeout for say 60s, then when it fires we compare
the timestamp with when the timeout was set. If the difference is
greater than (say) 65s, it's probable the computer has been asleep (thus
delaying the timeout's firing), and so we again create a new eventsource
object to replace the old one.</p>

<p>Lastly, it was reasonably straight forward to implement a fully
compatible eventsource implementation in Firefox using just a normal
XmlHttpRequest object, thereby making this feature work in FF3.5+ (we
haven't tested further back, but it may work in earlier versions too).
The only difference is that the browser can't release from memory any of
the data received over the eventsource connection until the connection
is closed (and they could be really long lived), as you can always
access it all through the XHR responseText property. However, we don't
actually know if the other browsers actually make this optimisation with
their native eventsource implementations, and given the data pushed
through the eventsource connection is normally quite small, this
certainly isn't an issue in practice.</p>

<p>This means we support Opera/Firefox/Chrome/Safari with the same server
implementation. To add Internet Explorer to the mix we use a long
polling approach. To make the server support long polling all we do is
make IE set a header on an XmlHttpRequest connection (we use
X-Long-Poll: Yes), and if the server sees that header it closes the
connection after every event is pushed; other than that it's exactly the
same. This also means IE can share FF's eventsource emulation class with
minimal changes.</p>

<p>The instant notification of new emails is one of core features of the
new interface that allows the blurring of boundaries between traditional
email clients and webmail clients. Making this feature work, and work in
a way that we knew was scalable going forward was an important
requirement for the new interface. We've achieved this with a straight
forward client solution, and in a way that elegantly integrates with our
existing backend infrastructure.</p>
