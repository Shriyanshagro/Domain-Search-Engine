<p class="blog-author"><a href="https://twitter.com/robn">Rob Norris</a> &ndash;  9 April 2013</p>
<p>"Cloud" storage is a big deal these days, and there's all sorts of great
ways to make your files available everywhere. FastMail has had an online
file storage facility for years, but there's other popular services out
there too. So recently we started thinking about how we could let you
use other file services from inside FastMail.</p>

<p>Dropbox is one of the most popular of these services, and we think they
do a great job of making it easy to access your files everywhere, no
matter what kind of device you use. That philosophy fits well with what
we're trying to do with FastMail, so it seemed like a natural fit to
make the two services work together.</p>

<p>So today we've released our Dropbox integration. Now when you attempt to
attach a file, you'll be offered a new option: "Attach From Dropbox".
The first time you use this you'll be asked to sign in to Dropbox and
authorise FastMail, but after that you'll be able to browse and attach
files from Dropbox just as easily as you can from your FastMail file
storage. Similarly, you can save attachments from your messages directly
to Dropbox.</p>

<p>We think this is pretty great. Now you can do things like save a
document to the Dropbox folder on your computer at home, then attach it
to an email you write from a friend's computer. you could save some
photos you received in a message to your Dropbox, and then use the
Dropbox app on your phone to access and share them, and have them ready
for you when you get home without having to do anything else.</p>

<p>Note that at no time does this give Dropbox access to your mail or any
data stored by FastMail. All access to your Dropbox is done using a
random authentication token that can not be linked back to your FastMail
account.</p>

<p>We're pretty excited about this feature, and hope you like it!</p>
