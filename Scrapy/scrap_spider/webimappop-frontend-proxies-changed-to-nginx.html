<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2007/01/04/webimappop-frontend-proxies-changed-to-nginx/'>Web/IMAP/POP frontend proxies changed to nginx</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  4 January 2007</p>
<p>A <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/?p=506">while back</a>, we changed our frontend
IMAP/POP proxy from
<a href="http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/">perdition</a> to
<a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a>. Perdition uses a traditional unix "one
process per connection" model to manage the proxying of IMAP/POP
requests. Because of the long lived nature of IMAP connections,
perdition was using over 8,000 processes on each of our frontend
machines. Even with Linux 2.6 and the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-scheduler/index.html">O(1)
scheduler</a>,
the machines were beginning to struggle with the large number of
processes, creating a sluggish feeling to IMAP connections.</p>

<p>Instead of a process per connection, nginx uses a small fixed process
pool and non-blocking code with
<a href="http://lse.sourceforge.net/epoll/index.html">epoll</a> (on linux) to
provide much higher scalability. At the time we first looked at nginx,
it only supported HTTP proxying, but we realised the underlying
architecture would be a good one for IMAP/POP proxying as well. With
that in mind, we contacted the author of nginx (<a href="http://sysoev.ru/">Igor
Sysoev</a> who we were already familiar with due to
<a href="http://sysoev.ru/en/">mod_accel</a>) to implement an IMAP/POP proxy in
nginx. We agreed to pay him for this, and to allow the code to be
included in the regular nginx distribution. Over the next couple of
months he implemented it, and after some testing and bug fixing, we
rolled it out to our frontend proxy servers in Sep 2005. The results for
us were dramatic. Load on our frontend servers dropped dramatically, and
IMAP/POP responsiveness improved noticeably.</p>

<p>Because web connections aren't as long lived as IMAP connections, we
stayed with Apache for our frontends for a while longer. However we've
now switched over to using nginx for our frontend web proxy as well,
which has also allowed us to increase the keep-alive timeout for HTTP
connections to 5 minutes, which should result in a small perceptible
improvement when moving between pages.</p>

<p>The net result of all this is that each frontend proxy server currently
maintains over 10,000 simultaneous IMAP, POP, Web &amp; SMTP connections
(including many SSL ones) using only about 10% of the available CPU on
3.20GHz Netburst Xeon based CPUs.</p>
