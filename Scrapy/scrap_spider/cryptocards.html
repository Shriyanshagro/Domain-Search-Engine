											<p>IBM Systems currently offers two high-end, high-performance hardware security modules (HSMs) which provide a flexible solution suitable for high-security processing and cryptographic operations to address your cryptographic needs. The latest generation and fastest of the IBM cryptographic coprocessor family of PCIe cards with a multi-chip embedded module is the IBM PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor Version 2 (PCIeCC2). Its predecessor is the IBM PCIe Cryptographic coprocessor Version 1 (PCIeCC).</p>
											
											<p><b>What's new.</b> In addition to the functions available on the PCIeCC, the PCIeCC2 has the following:</p>
											
											<ul class="ibm-bullet-list ibm-no-links">
												<li>Increased performance</li>
												<li>Hardware accelerated Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key generation, along with digital signature generation and verification using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).</li>
												<li>Enhanced firmware load security using ECDSA signatures</li>
												<li>Support for Visa Data Secure Platform with Point to Point Encryption (VDSP with P2PE), which includes Visa Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE)</li>
												<li>Access-control tracking can be performed on a role ID basis to gather information about which access control points are queried by applications</li>
												<li>Users of the HSM 4767 have enhanced logon control capabilities, including stricter passphrase length and character requirements and the ability for users to change their own passphrases.</li>
												<li>The ability to encipher and decipher data using the AES algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).</li>
												<li>The creation of symmetric key material from a pair of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) keys using the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol and the ANSI-9.63-KDF key derivation method as specified in ANSI X9.63-2011.</li>
												<li>Newly selectable RSA public exponents 5, 17, and 257. This addition completes the series of the first five Fermat numbers. The first five Fermat numbers are known to be prime.</li>
												<li>New distributed Function Control Vector (FCV) format for use by the IBM 4767. This FCV is digitally signed by IBM using a 521-bit ECC key using ECDSA. This provides an increased protection level compared to the FCV signed by IBM for the IBM 4765, which has a 4096-bit key using ANS X9.31.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<p><b>Highest cryptographic security available.</b> Each of IBM's HSM devices offers the highest cryptographic security available commercially. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are issued by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The PCIeCC cryptographic processes are performed within an enclosure on the HSM that is validated to FIPS PUB 140-2, <em>Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</em>, Overall Level 4. See <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm" class="ibm-external-link ibm-inlinelink ibm-icon-after" data-widget="tooltip" title="Link resides outside ibm.com">FIPS certification number 1505</a>. Level 4 is the highest level of certification achievable for commercial cryptographic devices, and the PCIeCC2 cryptographic processes are also performed within an enclosure on the HSM that are designed to meet the requirements of Overall Level 4. The certification process for the IBM 4767 Cryptographic Coprocessor Security Module has begun for Level 4, and is listed on the Computer Security Resource Center website in their <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/inprocess.html" class="ibm-external-link ibm-inlinelink ibm-icon-after" data-widget="tooltip" title="Link resides outside ibm.com">FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Modules In Process List</a>.</p>
											
											<p><b>Available on multiple platforms.</b> The PCIeCC2 and the PCIeCC are supported on the following platforms:</p>
											
											<ul class="ibm-bullet-list ibm-no-links"> 
												<li>IBM z Systems™</li>
												<li>IBM Power Systems™</li>
												<li>Select IBM-approved x86 architecture servers (formerly IBM System x)</li>

											<p><b>Specialized hardware relieves main processor from cryptographic tasks.</b> The PCIeCC2 and PCIeCC both have a PCIe local-bus-compatible interface, and both have tamper responding, programmable, cryptographic coprocessors, each containing a CPU, encryption hardware, RAM, persistent memory, hardware random number generator, time-of-day clock, infrastructure firmware, and software. Their specialized hardware performs AES, DES, TDES, RSA, ECC, AESKW, HMAC, DES/3DES/AES MAC, SHA-1, SHA-224 to SHA-512, SHA-3, and other cryptographic processes, relieving the main processor from these tasks. The coprocessor design protects your cryptographic keys and any sensitive customer applications.</p>
											
											<p><b>Customizable to meet special requirements.</b> The firmware running in the coprocessor together with the software running on your host can be customized to meet any special requirements that your enterprise has. The Cryptographic Coprocessor Toolkit (CCTK) is available for purchase from IBM, subject to the export regulations of the United States Government. The CCTK can enable developers to build applications for the HSM, authenticate programs, and load programs into the HSM. The custom programming toolkit includes a custom software interface reference which describes the function calls that applications running in the HSM use to obtain services from the HSM operating system and from the HSM host system device driver. Another included reference provides the method for extending the CCA host API and the API reference for the user-defined extensions programming environment. Finally, an Interactive Code Analysis Tool (ICAT) is provided that developers can use to debug applications running on the HSM. Frequently a custom contract provides consultation to hasten application development, and sometimes provides for initial development by IBM. Whenever needed, IBM is also able to bid on developing your custom solution or extension.</p>
											
											<p><b>Optional use of smart cards.</b> You can optionally use smarts cards with an IBM HSM. A Smart Card Utility Program (SCUP) is a GUI-based component available for use with the Cryptographic Node Management (CNM) utility (also GUI based) to manage smart cards with an IBM HSM. You can use SCUP to initialize smart cards that can then be used with CNM to generate and store CCA DES and PKA master key parts on supported smart cards, load CCA master key parts stored on supported smart cards, and log on to CCA using smart card CCA profiles tied to an RSA key pair associated with ah particular smart card and user profile. Smart cards are available for purchase from IBM, as well as additional assistance in setting up and configuring SCUP and CNM.</p>
											
											<p><b>CCA Java Native Interface (JNI).</b> In addition to support for C and C++ programming languages, the CCA Support Program includes a CCA Java Native Interface (JNI) that application programmers can use to build Java applications to use with the CCA Support Program. The IBM i Option 35, CCA Cryptographic Service Provider feature does not support the CCA JNI, but it does provide language bindings for COBOL, RPG, and CL.</p>
