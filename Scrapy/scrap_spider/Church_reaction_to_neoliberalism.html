<p>Pope Francis recently took issue with neoliberalism and related pseudo theory called trickle-down economics, 
which is designed to mask abject inequality usually created by neoliberal regimes (and resulting National 
Security State, where under the disguise of protecting citizens from terrorism&nbsp; protects top 1% 
financial gains). 
He stressed that so-called
<a href="../../../Financial_skeptic/Casino_capitalism/Pseudo_theories/Suppy_side_voodoo/supply_side_voodoo.shtml">
supply side economics</a> is a smoke screen for redistribution of wealth up by the financial oligarchy. 
As Eugene Patrick Devany noted in his comment to Paul Krugman&#39;s post
<a  target="_blank" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/the-case-for-techno-optimism/">The Case for Techno-optimism</a>

	<p>It seems that, &quot;a persistent shortfall on the demand side&quot; is a euphemism for the fact that 
	<em>half 
	the population will remain near bankruptcy for quite sometime.</em></p>

	<p>Pope Francis said two days ago</p>
	<blockquote>

		<p>&quot;To sustain a lifestyle which excludes others ... a globalization of indifference has developed. 
		Almost without being aware of it, <em>we end up being incapable of feeling compassion ...</em>&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>One may consider the Pope less qualified to &quot;pontificate&quot; about technology than Prof. Krugman 
	who &quot;tracks technology&quot; and sees that &quot;smart machines are getting much better at interacting with 
	the natural environment in all its complexity ... [and concluding] that a real transformative leap 
	is somewhere over the horizon&quot; Pope Francis said, </p>
	<blockquote>

		<p>&quot;This epochal change has been set in motion by the enormous qualitative, quantitative, rapid 
		and cumulative advances occurring in the sciences and in technology, and by their instant application 
		in different areas of nature and of life. We are in an age of knowledge and information, which 
		has led to new and often anonymous kinds of power.&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&quot;This epochal change&quot; seems to be a reference to &quot;fear and desperation, even in the so-called 
	rich countries&quot; and <em>to people forced to live &quot;with precious little dignity&quot;.</em></p>

	<p>The &quot;anonymous kinds of power&quot; could be a reference to &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot; - that connotes 
	business success to Americans and unbridled power to many developing countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best description of supply side or “trickle down” economics I ever heard was by JK Galbraith:</p>
<blockquote>

	<p>“trickle down economics is the idea that if you feed the horse enough oats eventually some will 
	pass through to the road for the sparrows.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That makes the Pope an economic realist ;-). </p>

<p>Not everybody was convinced by the sermon. Some suggested that Pope subject himself to a mortal danger 
proselytizing this way: </p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>

<p>... Such an [neoliberal] economy kills. How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly 
homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points? This is a case 
of exclusion. Can we continue to stand by when food is thrown away while people are starving? This is 
a case of inequality. Today everything comes under the laws of competition and the survival of the fittest, 
where the powerful feed upon the powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves excluded 
and marginalized: without work, without possibilities, without any means of escape.</p>

<p>Human beings are themselves considered consumer goods to be used and then discarded. We have created 
a “disposable” culture which is now spreading. It is no longer simply about exploitation and oppression, 
but something new. Exclusion ultimately has to do with what it means to be a part of the society in 
which we live; those excluded are no longer society’s underside or its fringes or its disenfranchised 
– they are no longer even a part of it. The excluded are not the “exploited” but the outcast, the “leftovers”.</p>

<p>54. In this context, some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic 
growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness 
in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve 
trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing 
economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting. To sustain a lifestyle which excludes others, 
or to sustain enthusiasm for that selfish ideal, a globalization of indifference has developed. Almost 
without being aware of it, we end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, 
weeping for other people’s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else’s 
responsibility and not our own. The culture of prosperity deadens us; we are thrilled if the market 
offers us something new to purchase; and in the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity 
seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.</p>

<h3><a name="No_to_the_new_idolatry_of_money">No to the new idolatry of money</a></h3>

<p>55. One cause of this situation is found in our relationship with money, since we calmly accept its 
dominion over ourselves and our societies. The current financial crisis can make us overlook the fact 
that it originated in a profound human crisis: the denial of the primacy of the human person! We have 
created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf (cf. <i>Ex </i>32:1-35) has returned in a 
new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking 
a truly human purpose. The worldwide crisis affecting finance and the economy lays bare their imbalances 
and, above all, their lack of real concern for human beings; man is reduced to one of his needs alone: 
consumption.</p>

<p></p>

<p>56. While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the 
majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few. This imbalance is the result of ideologies 
which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently, they 
reject the right of states, charged with vigilance for the common good, to exercise any form of control. 
A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes 
its own laws and rules. Debt and the accumulation of interest also make it difficult for countries to 
realize the potential of their own economies and keep citizens from enjoying their real purchasing power. 
To all this we can add widespread corruption and self-serving tax evasion, which have taken on worldwide 
dimensions. The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits. In this system, which tends to devour 
everything which stands in the way of increased profits, whatever is fragile, like the environment, 
is defenseless before the interests of a deified market, which become the only rule.</p>

<h3><a name="No_to_a_financial_system_which_rules_rather_than_serves">No to a financial system which 
rules rather than serves</a></h3>

<p>57. Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God. Ethics has come to be 
viewed with a certain scornful derision. It is seen as counterproductive, too human, because it makes 
money and power relative. It is felt to be a threat, since it condemns the manipulation and debasement 
of the person. In effect, ethics leads to a God who calls for a committed response which is outside 
of the categories of the marketplace. When these latter are absolutized, God can only be seen as uncontrollable, 
unmanageable, even dangerous, since he calls human beings to their full realization and to freedom from 
all forms of enslavement. Ethics – a non-ideological ethics – would make it possible to bring about 
balance and a more humane social order. With this in mind, I encourage financial experts and political 
leaders to ponder the words of one of the sages of antiquity: “Not to share one’s wealth with the poor 
is to steal from them and to take away their livelihood. It is not our own goods which we hold, but 
theirs”.<a name="_ftnref55" title href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html#_ftn55">[55]</a></p>

<p>58. A financial reform open to such ethical considerations would require a vigorous change of approach 
on the part of political leaders. I urge them to face this challenge with determination and an eye to 
the future, while not ignoring, of course, the specifics of each case. Money must serve, not rule! The 
Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but he is obliged in the name of Christ to remind all that 
the rich must help, respect and promote the poor. I exhort you to generous solidarity and a return of 
economics and finance to an ethical approach which favours human beings.</p>

<h3><a name="No_to_the_inequality_which_spawns_violence">No to the inequality which spawns violence</a></h3>

<p>59. Today in many places we hear a call for greater security. But until exclusion and inequality 
in society and between peoples is reversed, it will be impossible to eliminate violence. The poor and 
the poorer peoples are accused of violence, yet without equal opportunities the different forms of aggression 
and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode. When a society – whether 
local, national or global – is willing to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political programmes 
or resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance systems can indefinitely guarantee tranquility. 
This is not the case simply because inequality provokes a violent reaction from those excluded from 
the system, but because the socioeconomic system is unjust at its root. Just as goodness tends to spread, 
the toleration of evil, which is injustice, tends to expand its baneful influence and quietly to undermine 
any political and social system, no matter how solid it may appear. If every action has its consequences, 
an evil embedded in the structures of a society has a constant potential for disintegration and death. 
It is evil crystallized in unjust social structures, which cannot be the basis of hope for a better 
future. We are far from the so-called “end of history”, since the conditions for a sustainable and peaceful 
development have not yet been adequately articulated and realized.</p>

<p></p>

<p>60. Today’s economic mechanisms promote inordinate consumption, yet it is evident that unbridled 
consumerism combined with inequality proves doubly damaging to the social fabric. Inequality eventually 
engenders a violence which recourse to arms cannot and never will be able to resolve. This serves only 
to offer false hopes to those clamouring for heightened security, even though nowadays we know that 
weapons and violence, rather than providing solutions, create new and more serious conflicts. Some simply 
content themselves with blaming the poor and the poorer countries themselves for their troubles; indulging 
in unwarranted generalizations, they claim that the solution is an “education” that would tranquilize 
them, making them tame and harmless. All this becomes even more exasperating for the marginalized in 
the light of the widespread and deeply rooted corruption found in many countries – in their governments, 
businesses and institutions – whatever the political ideology of their leaders. </p>

by <i>Wendy Brown</i></h4>

<h5>I think Wendy Brown can he considered as a person who advanced Professor Wolin ideas to a new 
level ! Her <i>her new book <b>Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's 
   Stealth Revolution</b> (Zone Books, 2015) is a brilliant contribution to the field. </i></h5>

<h5>Notable quotes:</h5>
<h5>&quot;... I treat neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is "economized" and in     a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is     seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state)     is governed as a firm. Importantly, this is not simply a matter of extending commodification and     monetization everywhere-that's the old Marxist depiction of capital's transformation of everyday     life. Neoliberalism construes even non-wealth generating spheres-such as learning, dating, or exercising-in     market terms, submits them to market metrics, and governs them with market techniques and practices.     Above all, it casts people as human capital who must constantly tend to their own present and future     value. ...&quot;</h5>
<h5>&quot;... The most common criticisms of neoliberalism, regarded solely as economic     policy rather than as the broader phenomenon of a governing rationality, are that it generates and     legitimates extreme inequalities of wealth and life conditions; that it leads to increasingly precarious     and disposable populations; that it produces an unprecedented intimacy between capital (especially     finance capital) and states, and thus permits domination of political life by capital; that it generates     crass and even unethical commercialization of things rightly protected from markets, for example,     babies, human organs, or endangered species or wilderness; that it privatizes public goods and thus     eliminates shared and egalitarian access to them; and that it subjects states, societies, and individuals     to the volatility and havoc of unregulated financial markets. ...&quot;</h5>

<h5>&quot;... <em>with the neoliberal revolution that <i>homo politicus </i>is 
   finally vanquished as a fundamental feature of being human and of democracy. Democracy requires that 
   citizens be modestly oriented toward self-rule, not simply value enhancement, and that we understand 
   our freedom as resting in such self-rule, not simply in market conduct. When this dimension of being 
   human is extinguished, it takes with it the necessary energies, practices, and culture of democracy, 
   as well as its very intelligibility. ...&quot;</em></h5>

<h5>&quot;... For most Marxists, neoliberalism emerges in the 1970s in response to capitalism's falling rate 
   of profit; the shift of global economic gravity to OPEC, Asia, and other sites outside the West; 
   and the dilution of class power generated by unions, redistributive welfare states, large and lazy 
   corporations, and the expectations generated by educated democracies. <em>From this perspective, neoliberalism 
   is simply capitalism on steroids: a state and IMF-backed consolidation of class power aimed at releasing 
   capital from regulatory and national constraints, and defanging all forms of popular solidarities, 
   especially labor. ...&quot;</em></h5>

<h5>&quot;... The grains of truth in this analysis don't get at the fundamental transformation of social, cultural, 
   and individual life brought about by neoliberal reason. They don't get at the ways that public institutions 
   and services have not merely been outsourced but thoroughly recast as private goods for individual 
   investment or consumption. And they don't get at the wholesale remaking of workplaces, schools, social 
   life, and individuals. For that story, one has to track <em>the dissemination of neoliberal economization 
   through neoliberalism as a governing form of reason, not just a power grab by capital. There are 
   many vehicles of this dissemination -- law, culture, and above all, the novel political-administrative 
   form we have come to call governance. It is through governance practices that business models and 
   metrics come to irrigate every crevice of society, circulating from investment banks to schools, 
   from corporations to universities, from public agencies to the individual. It is through the replacement 
   of democratic terms of law, participation, and justice with idioms of benchmarks, objectives, and 
   buy-ins that governance dismantles democratic life while appearing only to instill it with "best 
   practices." ...&quot;</em></h5>

<h5>&quot;... Progressives generally disparage Citizens United for having flooded 
   the American electoral process with corporate money on the basis of tortured First Amendment reasoning 
   that treats corporations as persons. However, a careful reading of the majority decision also reveals 
   precisely the thoroughgoing economization of the terms and practices of democracy we have been talking 
   about. In the majority opinion, electoral campaigns are cast as "political marketplaces," just as 
   ideas are cast as freely circulating in a market where the only potential interference arises from 
   restrictions on producers and consumers of ideas-who may speak and who may listen or judge. Thus, 
   <em>Justice Kennedy's insistence on the fundamental neoliberal principle that these marketplaces should 
   be unregulated paves the way for overturning a century of campaign finance law aimed at modestly 
   restricting the power of money in politics.</em> Moreover, in the decision, political speech itself is 
   rendered as a kind of capital right, functioning largely to advance the position of its bearer, whether 
   that bearer is human capital, corporate capital, or finance capital. <em>This understanding of political 
   speech replaces the idea of democratic political speech as a vital (if potentially monopolizable 
   and corruptible) medium for public deliberation and persuasion. ...&quot;</em></h5>

<h5>&quot;... <em>My point was that democracy is really reduced to a whisper 
   in the Euro-Atlantic nations today. Even Alan Greenspan says that elections don't much matter much 
   because, "thanks to globalization . . . the world is governed by market forces," not elected representatives. 
...&quot;</em></h5>

   <p><i>Booked is a monthly series of Q&amp;As with authors by Dissent contributing editor Timothy Shenk. 
   For this interview, he spoke with Wendy Brown about her new book <b>Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's 
   Stealth Revolution</b> (Zone Books, 2015).</i></p><strong>Timothy Shenk:</strong> You note early in 
   <i>Undoing the Demos</i> that while references 
   to "neoliberalism" have become routine, especially on the left, the word itself "is a loose and shifting 
   signifier." What is your definition of neoliberalism?<p><strong>Wendy Brown:</strong> In this book, 
   <em>I treat neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is "economized" and in 
   a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is 
   seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) 
   is governed as a firm. Importantly, this is not simply a matter of extending commodification and 
   monetization everywhere-that's the old Marxist depiction of capital's transformation of everyday 
   life. Neoliberalism construes even non-wealth generating spheres-such as learning, dating, or exercising-in 
   market terms, submits them to market metrics, and governs them with market techniques and practices. 
   Above all, it casts people as human capital who must constantly tend to their own present and future 
   value.</em></p>

   <p>Moreover, because neoliberalism came of age with (and abetted) financialization, the form of marketization 
   at stake does not always concern products or commodities, let alone their exchange. Today, market 
   actors-from individuals to firms, universities to states, restaurants to magazines-are more often 
   concerned with their speculatively determined value, their ratings and rankings that shape future 
   value, than with immediate profit. All are tasked with enhancing present and future value through 
   self-investments that in turn attract investors. Financialized market conduct entails increasing 
   or maintaining one's ratings, whether through blog hits, retweets, Yelp stars, college rankings, 
   or Moody's bond ratings.</p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> Discussions about neoliberalism often treat it as an economic doctrine, 
   which also means that they concentrate on its economic ramifications. You shift the focus to politics, 
   where, you argue, neoliberalism has "inaugurate[d] democracy's conceptual unmooring and substantive 
   disembowelment." Why does neoliberalism pose such a threat to democracy?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> <em>The most common criticisms of neoliberalism, regarded solely as economic 
   policy rather than as the broader phenomenon of a governing rationality, are that it generates and 
   legitimates extreme inequalities of wealth and life conditions; that it leads to increasingly precarious 
   and disposable populations; that it produces an unprecedented intimacy between capital (especially 
   finance capital) and states, and thus permits domination of political life by capital; that it generates 
   crass and even unethical commercialization of things rightly protected from markets, for example, 
   babies, human organs, or endangered species or wilderness; that it privatizes public goods and thus 
   eliminates shared and egalitarian access to them; and that it subjects states, societies, and individuals 
   to the volatility and havoc of unregulated financial markets.</em></p>

   <p>Each of these is an important and objectionable effect of neoliberal economic policy. But neoliberalism 
   also does profound damage to democratic practices, cultures, institutions, and imaginaries. Here's 
   where thinking about neoliberalism as a governing rationality is important: this rationality switches 
   the meaning of democratic values from a political to an economic register. Liberty is disconnected 
   from either political participation or existential freedom, and is reduced to market freedom unimpeded 
   by regulation or any other form of government restriction. Equality as a matter of legal standing 
   and of participation in shared rule is replaced with the idea of an equal right to compete in a world 
   where there are always winners and losers.</p>

   <p>The promise of democracy depends upon concrete institutions and practices, but also on an understanding 
   of democracy as the specifically political reach by the people to hold and direct powers that otherwise 
   dominate us. Once the economization of democracy's terms and elements is enacted in law, culture, 
   and society, popular sovereignty becomes flatly incoherent. In markets, the good is generated by 
   individual activity, not by shared political deliberation and rule. And, where there are only individual 
   capitals and marketplaces, the demos, the people, do not exist.</p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> It's easy to depict neoliberalism as a natural extension of liberalism, 
   but you insist that the relationship is much more complicated than that. You illustrate the broad 
   transformation by examining the intellectual history of <i>homo economicus</i>, a term whose meaning 
   you claim has shifted radically since the time of Adam Smith. How has "economic man" changed in the 
   last century?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> You're right, the relationship is quite complicated, especially if one 
   accepts Foucault's notion that neoliberalism is a "reprogramming of liberalism" rather than only 
   a transformation of capitalism. Here are the simplest things we might say about the morphing of
   <i>homo economicus</i>. Two hundred years ago, this creature pursued its interest through what 
   Adam Smith termed "truck, barter, and exchange." A generation later, Jeremy Bentham gives us the 
   utility maximizer, calculating everything according to maximizing pleasure, minimizing pain-cost/benefit. 
   Thirty years ago, at the dawn of the neoliberal era, we get human capital that entrepreneurializes 
   itself at every turn. Today, <i>homo economicus</i> has been significantly reshaped as financialized 
   human capital, seeking to enhance its value in every domain of life.</p>

   <p>In contrast with classical economic liberalism, then, the contemporary figure of <i>homo economicus
   </i>is distinctive in at least two ways.<em> First, for neoliberals, humans are only and everywhere
   <i>homo economicus</i>. This was not so for classical economists, where we were market creatures 
   in the economy, but not in civic, familial, political, religious, or ethical life. Second, neoliberal
   <i>homo economicus</i> today takes shape as value-enhancing human capital, not as a creature of 
   exchange, production, or even interest. This is markedly different from the subject drawn by Smith, 
   Bentham, Marx, Polanyi, or even Gary Becker.</em></p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> You mentioned Foucault just now, and you devote two chapters to him in 
   the book, where you also call <i>Birth of Biopolitics-</i>the volume that emerged from lectures 
   he gave in the late 1970s on neoliberalism-a "remarkable" work of "extraordinary prescience." But 
   he also comes in for a hefty amount of criticism. What do you think Foucault got right, and what 
   did he miss?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> What's amazing about Foucault's lectures is that he grasped neoliberalism 
   as Europe's present and future in the 1970s-before Reagan or Thatcher were elected, and before the 
   Washington Consensus. What's also extraordinary is his appreciation of neoliberalism as a form of 
   political reason and governing that reaches from the state to the soul, and not simply as economic 
   policy. Then there's simply the fact that Foucault is a fearless, deep, and profoundly original political-historical 
   thinker, who probes archives or a single utterance with equal brilliance and imagination. These features 
   make Foucault's lectures illuminating despite the fact that he is mostly discussing neoliberal ideas, 
   not neoliberalism as it has unfolded over the past three decades.</p>

   <p>But there are some distinctive gaps in Foucault's account of what neoliberalism is and does resulting 
   from his allergies to Marxism at the point in his life when he's giving these lectures. For Foucault, 
   as I said, neoliberalism is fundamentally a "reprogramming of liberalism," not of capitalism, and 
   there is astonishingly little discussion of the latter. He is also largely indifferent to my own 
   central concern, democracy, which was true across his work. So one takes the useful insights and 
   then builds on them. It would be silly to be an "orthodox Foucauldian" on the subject of neoliberalism, 
   or for that matter, on any subject.</p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> What about the politics of Foucault's analysis? There's been a lot of 
   debate recently about whether he was so attuned to neoliberalism's rise because his own work was 
   compatible with neoliberalism. What's your position on this?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> Well, on the one hand, Foucault's degree of sympathy with what he was 
   studying is not, for me, particularly important. The usefulness of certain historical accounts and 
   theoretical formulations turns on their capacities for illumination, not on the theorist's political 
   affinities. (No one who mines the history of political theory to think about our present can draw 
   only from theorists whose affinities line up with contemporary progressive values. None would survive 
   the test, and that's also a poor approach to learning from great minds.) Moreover, he didn't and 
   couldn't have anticipated the neoliberal formations we are grappling with today. On the other hand, 
   the idea that Foucault was deeply attracted to neoliberalism for its "emancipatory" dimensions strikes 
   me as incompatible with a careful reading of his lectures where, among other things, he considers 
   neoliberalism as a novel form of governing human beings that requires the individual, as human capital, 
   to become a "portfolio of enterprises" and that makes us into both "producers and consumers of freedom." 
   Foucault's signature theoretical move is to grasp human beings as produced by governing powers, not 
   "freed" by them.</p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> <i>Homo economicus </i>is a fairly common term; less common is the 
   notion you oppose it to, <i>homo politicus. </i>What's the genealogy of <i>homo politicus</i>, 
   and how is it related to its more famous counterpart?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> To understand what neoliberalism is doing to democracy, we have to return 
   to the point that, until recently, human beings in the West have always been figured as more than
   <i>homo economicus</i>. There have always been other dimensions of us imagined and cultivated 
   in political, cultural, religious, or familial life. One of these figurations, which we might call
   <i>homo politicus</i>, featured prominently in ancient Athens, Roman republicanism, and even early 
   liberalism. But it has also appeared in modern democratic upheavals ranging from the French Revolution 
   to the civil rights movement. <i>Homo politicus</i> is inconstant in form and content, just as
   <i>homo economicus </i>is, and certainly liberal democracy features an anemic version compared 
   to, say, Aristotle's account of humans as realizing our distinctively human capacities through sharing 
   rule in the polis. But it is only <em>with the neoliberal revolution that <i>homo politicus </i>is 
   finally vanquished as a fundamental feature of being human and of democracy. Democracy requires that 
   citizens be modestly oriented toward self-rule, not simply value enhancement, and that we understand 
   our freedom as resting in such self-rule, not simply in market conduct. When this dimension of being 
   human is extinguished, it takes with it the necessary energies, practices, and culture of democracy, 
   as well as its very intelligibility.</em></p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> Some of the major interpreters of neoliberalism, especially those who 
   approach it from a Marxist perspective, depict it as a straightforward byproduct of 1970s economic 
   turmoil and backlash against welfare states led by a revanchist capitalist elite. It seems like you're 
   not satisfied with that interpretation. This is a big question, but do you have an alternative explanation 
   for how we got here?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> That's too long and complicated a story to rehearse here but I can say 
   this. <em>For most Marxists, neoliberalism emerges in the 1970s in response to capitalism's falling rate 
   of profit; the shift of global economic gravity to OPEC, Asia, and other sites outside the West; 
   and the dilution of class power generated by unions, redistributive welfare states, large and lazy 
   corporations, and the expectations generated by educated democracies. From this perspective, neoliberalism 
   is simply capitalism on steroids: a state and IMF-backed consolidation of class power aimed at releasing 
   capital from regulatory and national constraints, and defanging all forms of popular solidarities, 
   especially labor.</em></p>

   <p><em>The grains of truth in this analysis don't get at the fundamental transformation of social, cultural, 
   and individual life brought about by neoliberal reason. They don't get at the ways that public institutions 
   and services have not merely been outsourced but thoroughly recast as private goods for individual 
   investment or consumption. And they don't get at the wholesale remaking of workplaces, schools, social 
   life, and individuals. For that story, one has to track the dissemination of neoliberal economization 
   through neoliberalism as a governing form of reason, not just a power grab by capital. There are 
   many vehicles of this dissemination-law, culture, and above all, the novel political-administrative 
   form we have come to call governance. It is through governance practices that business models and 
   metrics come to irrigate every crevice of society, circulating from investment banks to schools, 
   from corporations to universities, from public agencies to the individual. It is through the replacement 
   of democratic terms of law, participation, and justice with idioms of benchmarks, objectives, and 
   buy-ins that governance dismantles democratic life while appearing only to instill it with "best 
   practices."</em></p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> <i>Undoing the Demos</i> covers a sizable amount of ground in just over 
   200 pages, but, as your discussion of governance just now indicates, you also spend a lot of time 
   with specific instances of neoliberalism in action. My favorite of these more focused studies is 
   your extended analysis of <i>Citizens United</i>. What does that case tell us about neoliberalism 
   more generally?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> <em>Progressives generally disparage <i>Citizens United </i>for having flooded 
   the American electoral process with corporate money on the basis of tortured First Amendment reasoning 
   that treats corporations as persons. However, a careful reading of the majority decision also reveals 
   precisely the thoroughgoing economization of the terms and practices of democracy we have been talking 
   about. In the majority opinion, electoral campaigns are cast as "political marketplaces," just as 
   ideas are cast as freely circulating in a market where the only potential interference arises from 
   restrictions on producers and consumers of ideas-who may speak and who may listen or judge. Thus, 
   Justice Kennedy's insistence on the fundamental neoliberal principle that these marketplaces should 
   be unregulated paves the way for overturning a century of campaign finance law aimed at modestly 
   restricting the power of money in politics. Moreover, in the decision, political speech itself is 
   rendered as a kind of capital right, functioning largely to advance the position of its bearer, whether 
   that bearer is human capital, corporate capital, or finance capital. This understanding of political 
   speech replaces the idea of democratic political speech as a vital (if potentially monopolizable 
   and corruptible) medium for public deliberation and persuasion.</em></p>

   <p>Perhaps what is most significant about the <i>Citizens United </i>decision, then, is not that 
   corporations are rendered as persons, but that persons, let alone a people, do not appear as the 
   foundation of democracy, and a distinctly public sphere of debate and discussion do not appear as 
   democracy's vital venue. Instead, the decision presents speech as a capital right and political life 
   and elections as marketplaces.</p>

   <p><strong>Shenk:</strong> You're clear that democracy is an ideal that deserves defending, but you're 
   skeptical about actually existing democracy, which you describe as a system where "the common rage 
   of the common citizen has been glorified and exploited." And you worry that matters could get much 
   worse, with democracy as we know it giving way to "a polity in which the people are pawns of every 
   kind of modern power." Do you see a tension between your tributes to democratic ideals and your grim 
   assessment of its current state?</p>

   <p><strong>Brown:</strong> Democracy is always incomplete, always short of its promise, but the conditions 
   for cultivating it can be better or worse. <em>My point was that democracy is really reduced to a whisper 
   in the Euro-Atlantic nations today. Even Alan Greenspan says that elections don't much matter much 
   because, "thanks to globalization . . . the world is governed by market forces," not elected representatives.</em> 
   Voting has been declining for decades everywhere in the Western world; politicians are generally 
   mistrusted if not reviled (except for Varoufakis, of course!); and everything to do with political 
   life or government is widely considered either captured by capital, corrupt or burdensome -- this hostility 
   to the political itself is generated by neoliberal reason. Thus, today, the meaning of democracy 
   is pretty much reduced to personal liberty. Such liberty is not nothing, but could not be further 
   from the idea of rule by and for the people.  </p>

<h5>Religion is definitely a useful tool fight neoliberalism. Actually outside of far right and religious 
fundamentalists almost any tool that is useful for fighting neoliberalism should be viewed positively. 
Currently Catholicism opposes neoliberalism more actively and probably somewhat more successfully due 
to the statute of Pope Francis then Orthodox Church.</h5>

<h6>May 21, 2015  |  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulcoyer/2015/05/21/unholy-alliance-vladimir-putin-and-the-russian-orthodox-church/"> Forbes</a></h6>


   <p>Amidst the geopolitical confrontation between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the US and its allies, 
   little attention has been paid to the role played by religion either as a shaper of Russian domestic 
   politics or as a means of understanding Putin's international actions. The role of religion has long 
   tended to get short thrift in the study of statecraft (although it has been experiencing a bit of 
   a renaissance of late), yet nowhere has it played a more prominent role – and perhaps nowhere has 
   its importance been more unrecognized – than in its role in supporting the Russian state and Russia's 
   current place in world affairs.</p>

   <p>And while much attention has been paid to the growing authoritarianism of the Kremlin and on the 
   support for Putin's regime on the part of the Russian oligarchs whom Putin has enriched through his 
   crony capitalism, little has been paid to the equally critical role of the Russian Orthodox Church 
   in helping to shape Russia's current system, and in supporting Putin's regime and publicly conflating 
   the mission of the Russian state under Vladimir Putin's leadership with the mission of the Church. 
   Putin's move in close coordination with the Russian Orthodox Church to sacralize the Russian national 
   identity has been a key factor shaping the increasingly authoritarian bent of the Russian government 
   under Putin, and strengthening his public support, and must be understood in order to understand 
   Russia's international behavior.</p>

   <p>The close relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and the Russian state based upon 
   a shared, theologically-informed vision of Russian exceptionalism is not a new phenomenon. During 
   the days of the Czar, the Russian ruler was seen as God's chosen ruler of a Russian nation tasked 
   with representing a unique set of value embodied by Russian Orthodoxy, and was revered as "the Holy 
   Orthodox Czar". Today, a not dissimilar vision of Russian exceptionalism is once again shared by 
   the ROC and the Kremlin, and many Russians are beginning to see Vladimir Putin in a similar vein 
   – a perception encouraged both by Putin and by the Church, each of which sees the other as a valuable 
   political ally and sees their respective missions as being interrelated.</p>

   <p>... ... ... </p>

   <p>When Putin came to power he shrewdly noted the ROC's useful role in boosting nationalism and the 
   fact that it shared his view of Russia's role in the world, and began to work toward strengthening 
   the Church's role in Russian society. Early in his presidency the Russian Duma passed a law returning 
   all church property seized during the Soviet era (which act alone made the ROC one of the largest 
   landholders in Russia). Over the past decade and a half, Putin has ordered state-owned energy firms 
   to contribute billions to the rebuilding of thousands of churches destroyed under the Soviets, and 
   many of those rich oligarchs surrounding him are dedicated supporters of the ROC who have contributed 
   to the growing influence of the church in myriad ways. Around 25,000 ROC churches have been built 
   or rebuilt since the early 1990&#8242;s, the vast majority of which have been built during Putin's rule 
   and largely due to his backing and that of those in his close circle of supporters. Additionally, 
   the ROC has been given rights that have vastly increased its role in public life, including the right 
   to teach religion in Russia's public schools and the right to review any legislation before the Russian 
   Duma.</p>

   <p>The glue that holds together the alliance between Vladimir Putin and the ROC, and the one that 
   more than any other explains their mutually-supporting actions, is their shared, sacralized vision 
   of Russian national identity and exceptionalism. Russia, according to this vision, is neither Western 
   nor Asian, but rather a unique society representing a unique set of values which are believed to 
   be divinely inspired. The Kremlin's chief ideologue in this regard is Alexander Dugin (see a good 
   summary of the historical roots of Dugin's philosophy and of his impact on the Russian government
   <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141080/anton-barbashin-and-hannah-thoburn/putins-brain">
   here</a>.) According to this vision of the relationship between church, state, and society, the state 
   dominates, the ROC partnering with the state, and individuals and private organizations supporting 
   both church and state. This has provided the ideological justification for Putin's crackdown on dissent, 
   and the rationale behind the Church's cooperation with the Kremlin in the repression of civil society 
   groups or other religious groups which have dissenting political views. And the ROC's hostility toward 
   the activities in Russia of other religious groups have dovetailed with that of Putin, who views 
   independent religious activity as a potential threat to his regime.</p>

   <p>Internationally, Russia's mission is to expand its influence and authority until it dominates 
   the Eurasian landmass, by means of a strong central Russian state controlling this vast territory 
   and aligned with the ROC as the arm of the Russian nation exercising its cultural influence. This 
   vision of Russian exceptionalism has met with broad resonance within Russia, which goes a long way 
   to explaining Putin's sky high polling numbers. Putin has successfully been able both to transfer 
   to himself the social trust placed by most Russians in the ROC and has also to wrap himself in the 
   trappings of almost a patron saint of Russia. <em>The conflict between Russia and the West, therefore, 
   is portrayed by both the ROC and by Vladimir Putin and his cohorts as nothing less than a spiritual/civilizational 
   conflict.</em> If anyone thought Europe's wars over religion were finished in 1648, the current standoff 
   with Russia illustrates that that is not the case.</p>

In Fiery Speeches, Francis Excoriates Global Capitalism</a> by

<h5><em>The French economist Thomas Piketty argued last 
         year in a surprising best-seller, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," that rising wealth 
         inequality was a natural result of free-market policies, a direct challenge to the

         <h6>Jul 11, 2015  | 
         <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/in-fiery-speeches-francis-excoriates-global-capitalism/ar-AAcRz9j?srcref=rss">

         <p>ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — His speeches can blend 
         biblical fury with apocalyptic doom. Pope Francis does not just criticize the excesses of 
         global capitalism. He compares them to the "dung of the devil." He does not simply argue 
         that systemic "greed for money" is a bad thing. He calls it a "subtle dictatorship" that 
         "condemns and enslaves men and women." </p>

         <p>Having returned to his native Latin America, 
         Francis has renewed his left-leaning critiques on the inequalities of capitalism, 
         describing it as an underlying cause of global injustice, and a prime cause of climate 
         change. Francis escalated that line last week when he made a
         <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/world/americas/pope-francis-bolivia-catholic-church-apology.html">
         historic apology for the crimes of the Roman Catholic Church</a> during the period of 
         Spanish colonialism — even as he called for a global movement against a "new colonialism" 
         rooted in an inequitable economic order.</p>

         <p>The Argentine pope seemed to be asking for a social 
         revolution.</p>

         <p>"This is not theology as usual; this is him 
         shouting from the mountaintop," said Stephen F. Schneck, the director of the Institute for 
         Policy Research and Catholic studies at Catholic University of America in Washington.</p>

         <p>The last pope who so boldly placed himself at the 
         center of the global moment was John Paul II, who during the 1980s pushed the church to 
         confront what many saw as the challenge of that era, communism. John Paul II's 
         anti-Communist messaging dovetailed with the agenda of political conservatives eager for a 
         tougher line against the Soviets and, in turn, aligned part of the church hierarchy with 
         the political right. </p>

         <p>Francis has defined the economic challenge of this 
         era as the failure of global capitalism to create fairness, equity and dignified 
         livelihoods for the poor — a social and religious agenda that coincides with a resurgence 
         of the leftist thinking marginalized in the days of John Paul II. Francis' increasingly 
         sharp critique comes as much of humanity has never been so wealthy or well fed — yet rising 
         inequality and repeated financial crises have unsettled voters, policy makers and 
         economists.</p>

         <p>Left-wing populism is surging in countries immersed 
         in economic turmoil, such as Spain, and,
         <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis-athens-poverty-inequality.html?">
         most notably, Greece</a>. But even in the United States, where the economy has rebounded, 
         widespread concern about inequality and corporate power are propelling the
         <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/26/bernie-sanders-a-revolution-with-an-eye-on-the-hungry-children/">
         rise of liberals like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont</a> and Senator Elizabeth Warren of 
         Massachusetts, who, in turn, have pushed the Democratic Party presidential front-runner, 
         Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the left.</p>

         <p>Even some free-market champions are now reassessing 
         the shortcomings of unfettered capitalism. George Soros, who made billions in the markets, 
         and then spent a good part of it promoting the spread of free markets in Eastern Europe, 
         now argues that the pendulum has swung too far the other way. </p>

         <p>"I think the pope is singing to the music that's 
         already in the air," said Robert A. Johnson, executive director of the Institute for New 
         Economic Thinking, which was financed with $50 million from Mr. Soros. "And that's a good 
         thing. That's what artists do, and I think the pope is sensitive to the lack of legitimacy 
         of the system."</p>

         <p>Many Catholic scholars would argue that Francis is 
         merely continuing a line of Catholic social teaching that has existed for more than a 
         century and was embraced even by his two conservative predecessors, John Paul II and 
         Benedict XVI. Pope Leo XIII first called for economic justice on behalf of workers in 1891, 
         with his encyclical "Rerum Novarum" — or, "On Condition of Labor." </p>

         <p>Mr. Schneck, of Catholic University, said it was as 
         if Francis were saying, "We've been talking about these things for more than one hundred 
         years, and nobody is listening."</p>

         <p>Francis has such a strong sense of urgency "because 
         he has been on the front lines with real people, not just numbers and abstract ideas," Mr. 
         Schneck said. "That real-life experience of working with the most marginalized in Argentina 
         has been the source of his inspiration as pontiff." </p>

         <p>Francis made his speech on Wednesday night, in 
         Santa Cruz, Bolivia, before nearly 2,000 social advocates, farmers, trash workers and 
         neighborhood activists. Even as he meets regularly with heads of state, Francis has often 
         said that change must come from the grass roots, whether from poor people or the community 
         organizers who work with them. To Francis, the poor have earned knowledge that is useful 
         and redeeming, even as a "throwaway culture" tosses them aside. He sees them as being at 
         the front edge of economic and environmental crises around the world.</p>

         <p>In Bolivia, Francis praised cooperatives and other 
         localized organizations that he said provide productive economies for the poor. "How 
         different this is than the situation that results when those left behind by the formal 
         market are exploited like slaves!" he said on Wednesday night.</p>

         <p>It is this Old Testament-like rhetoric that some 
         finding jarring, perhaps especially so in the United States, where Francis will visit in 
         September. His environmental encyclical, "Laudato Si'," released last month, drew loud 
         criticism from some American conservatives and from others who found his language deeply 
         pessimistic. His right-leaning critics also argued that he was overreaching and straying 
         dangerously beyond religion — while condemning capitalism with too broad a brush.</p>

         <p>"I wish Francis would focus on positives, on how a 
         free-market economy guided by an ethical framework, and the rule of law, can be a part of 
         the solution for the poor — rather than just jumping from the reality of people's misery to 
         the analysis that a market economy is the problem," said the Rev. Robert A. Sirico, 
         president of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, which advocates 
         free-market economics.</p>

         <p>Francis' sharpest critics have accused him of being 
         a Marxist or a Latin American Communist, even as he opposed communism during his time in 
         Argentina. His tour last week of Latin America began in Ecuador and Bolivia, two countries 
         with far-left governments. President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who wore a Che Guevara patch 
         on his jacket during Francis' speech, claimed the pope as a kindred spirit — even as 
         Francis seemed startled and caught off guard when Mr. Morales gave him a wooden crucifix 
         shaped like a hammer and sickle as a gift.</p>

         <p>Francis' primary agenda last week was to begin 
         renewing Catholicism in Latin America and reposition it as the church of the poor. His 
         apology for the church's complicity in the colonialist era received an immediate roar from 
         the crowd. In various parts of Latin America, the association between the church and 
         economic power elites remains intact. In Chile, a socially conservative country, some 
         members of the country's corporate elite are also members of Opus Dei, the traditionalist 
         Catholic organization founded in Spain in 1928.</p>

         <p>Inevitably, Francis' critique can be read as a 
         broadside against Pax Americana, the period of capitalism regulated by global institutions 
         created largely by the United States. But even pillars of that system are shifting. The 
         World Bank, which long promoted economic growth as an end in itself, is now increasingly 
         focused on the distribution of gains, after the Arab Spring revolts in some countries that 
         the bank had held up as models. The latest generation of international trade agreements 
         includes efforts to increase protections for workers and the environment.</p>

         <p><em>The French economist Thomas Piketty argued last 
         year in a surprising best-seller, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," that rising wealth 
         inequality was a natural result of free-market policies, a direct challenge to the 
         conventional view that economic inequalities shrink over time. The controversial 
         implication drawn by Mr. Piketty is that governments should raise taxes on the wealthy.</em></p>

         <p>Mr. Piketty roiled the debate among mainstream 
         economists, yet Francis' critique is more unnerving to some because he is not reframing 
         inequality and poverty around a new economic theory but instead defining it in moral terms. 
         <em>"Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere 
         philanthropy," he said on Wednesday. "It is a moral obligation. For Christians, the 
         responsibility is even greater: It is a commandment."</em></p>

         <p>Nick Hanauer, a Seattle venture capitalist, said 
         that he saw Francis as making a nuanced point about capitalism, embodied by his coinage of 
         a "social mortgage" on accumulated wealth — a debt to the society that made its 
         accumulation possible. Mr. Hanauer said that economic elites should embrace the need for 
         reforms both for moral and pragmatic reasons.<em> "I'm a believer in capitalism but it comes in as 
         many flavors as pie, and we have a choice about the kind of capitalist system that we 
         have," said Mr. Hanauer, now an outspoken proponent of redistributive government</em> policies 
         like a higher minimum wage.</p>

         <p>Yet what remains unclear is whether Francis has a 
         clear vision for a systemic alternative to the status quo that he and others criticize. 
         "All these critiques point toward the incoherence of the simple idea of free market 
         economics, but they don't prescribe a remedy," said Mr. Johnson, of the Institute for New 
         Economic Thinking.</p>

         <p>Francis acknowledged as much, conceding on 
         Wednesday that he had no new "recipe" to quickly change the world. Instead, he spoke about 
         a "process of change" undertaken at the grass-roots level.</p>

         <p><em>"What can be done by those students, those young 
         people, those activists, those missionaries who come to my neighborhood with the hearts 
         full of hopes and dreams but without any real solution for my problems?" he asked. "A lot! 
         They can do a lot. </em>"You, the lowly, the exploited, the poor and 
         underprivileged, can do, and are doing, a lot. I would even say that the future of humanity 
         is in great measure in your own hands."</p>

   The Guardian</a></h6>

   <p>Pope Francis  has urged the downtrodden to change the world economic order, denouncing a 
   "new colonialism" by agencies that impose austerity programs and calling for the poor to have the 
   "sacred rights" of labor, lodging and land.</p>

   <p>In one of the longest, most passionate and sweeping speeches of his pontificate, the Argentine-born 
   pope used his visit to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia">Bolivia</a> 
   to ask forgiveness for the sins committed by the Roman Catholic church in its treatment of native 
   Americans during what he called the "so-called conquest of America".</p>

   <p>The pontiff also demanded an immediate end to what he called the "genocide" of Christians taking 
   place in the Middle East and beyond, describing it as a third world war.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>"Today we are dismayed to see how in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world many of our 
      brothers and sisters are persecuted, tortured and killed for their faith in Jesus," Pope Francis 
      said.</p>

      <p>"In this third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of genocide 
      is taking place, and it must end."</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Quoting a fourth century bishop, <em>he called the unfettered pursuit of money "the dung of the 
   devil", and said poor countries should not be reduced to being providers of raw material and cheap 
   labour for developed countries. </em></p>

   <p>Repeating some of the themes of his
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/popes-climate-change-encyclical-calls-on-rich-nations-to-pay-social-debt">
   landmark encyclical Laudato Si </a>on the environment last month, Francis said time was running out 
   to save the planet from perhaps irreversible harm to the ecosystem. </p>

   Evo Morales, right, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/AP </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE>

                <p>Francis made the address in the city of Santa Cruz to participants of the second 
                world meeting of popular movements, an international body that brings together organisations 
                of people on the margins of society, including the poor, the unemployed and peasants 
                who have lost their land. The Vatican hosted the first meeting last year. </p>

   <p><em>He said he supported their efforts to obtain "so elementary and undeniably necessary a right 
   as that of the three "Ls": land, lodging and labour".</em></p>

   <p>His speech was preceded by lengthy remarks from the left-wing Bolivian president
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/evo-morales">Evo Morales</a>, who wore 
   a jacket adorned with the face of Argentine revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara. He was executed 
   in Bolivia in 1967 by CIA-backed Bolivian troops.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p><em>"Let us not be afraid to say it: we want change, real change, structural change," the pope 
      said, decrying a system that "has imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern 
      for social exclusion or the destruction of nature".</em></p>

      <p>"This system is by now intolerable: farm workers find it intolerable, labourers find it intolerable, 
      communities find it intolerable, peoples find it intolerable. The earth itself – our sister, Mother 
      Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable," he said in an hour-long speech 
      that was interrupted by applause and cheering dozens of times. </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Since his election in 2013, the first pope from Latin America has often spoken out in defence 
   of the poor and against unbridled capitalism but the speech in Santa Cruz was the most comprehensive 
   to date on the issues he has championed. </p>

   <p>Francis' previous attacks on capitalism have prompted stiff criticism from politicians and commentators 
   in the United States, where he is due to visit in September. </p>

   <p>The pontiff appeared to take a swipe at international monetary organisations such as the IMF and 
   the development aid policies by some developed countries. </p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>"No actual or established power has the right to deprive peoples of the full exercise of their 
      sovereignty. Whenever they do so, we see the rise of new forms of colonialism which seriously 
      prejudice the possibility of peace and justice," he said. </p>

      <p>"<em>The new colonialism takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence 
      of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain 'free trade' treaties, and the imposition of measures 
      of 'austerity' which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor</em>," he said. </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Last week, Francis called on European authorities to keep human dignity at the centre of debate 
   for a solution to the economic crisis in Greece.</p>

   <p>He defended labor unions and praised poor people who had formed cooperatives to create jobs where 
   previously "there were only crumbs of an idolatrous economy". </p>

   <p>In one of the sections on colonialism, he said: </p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>"I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of 
      America in the name of God." </p>
       <ASIDE data-link-name="rich-link-2 | 2" data-component="rich-link">
       </ASIDE>

       <p>He added: "I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offences of the church herself, but 
       also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.
      </p>

      <p>"There was sin and an abundant amount of it." </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>The audience gave Francis a standing ovation when he put on a yellow miner's hat that was given 
   to him at the end of his speech. </p>

   <p>The pope made his speech at the end of his first full day in Bolivia, where he arrived on Wednesday. 
   On Thursday morning he said a mass for hundreds of thousands of people and said that everyone had 
   a moral duty to help the poor, and that those with means could not wish they would just "go away".</p>

   <p>Francis praised Bolivia's social reforms to spread wealth under Morales. On Friday, he will visit 
   Bolivia's notoriously violent Palmasola prison. </p>

   <p>The pope
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/bolivia-communist-crucifix-gift-pope-francis">
   looked bemused on Wednesday night </a>when Morales handed him one of the more unusual gifts he has 
   received: a sculpted wooden hammer and sickle – the symbol of communism – with a figure of a crucified 
   Christ resting on the hammer. <br>
   Francis leaves on Friday for Paraguay, the last stop on his "homecoming" trip.</p>

      <p>He has hit the nail on the head. This is everything that is wrong with society. Every decision 
      is taken with regards to making as much money as possible. However, the great irony is that even 
      if people do make money, their constant desire for more means they are never happy or fulfilled.

      <p>As a Unitarian/Universalist I am equally, if not more, wary of that practice. Francis, however, 
      is a public figure who has the right to express his opinion. While he was definitely speaking 
      to a Catholic audience, he was not giving his words the weight of a Papal Encyclical. Also, it 
      is the accepted and expected belief of Catholics that the Pope directs their thinking as far as 
      faith goes. I do not see his words being a act of forcing his will on me, personally. All public 
      figures have the right to express their opinion on that subject. I also believe that regulation 
      should go further than dealing with "negative externalities" unless you view the financial crisis 
      of 2008 as a negative externality . While the causes of the crisis were complex and varied, lax 
      regulatory oversight during the Reagan and Clinton Administrations played a role in creating the 
      conditions for it.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m glad you set everyone straight on this. We were all thinking capitalism is an economic

      and environmental destruction. The very fact you&#39;ve attempted to pick at this shows you&#39;re missing 
      the overarching point. The Pope is criticizing how our unregulated &quot;socioeconomic system&quot; - which 
      was capitalism the last time I looked - for being responsible for ruining society, enslaving men

      It&#39;s nothing like the Guardian&#39;s deceptive headline. </p>

      <blockquote>

         <p>Today, the scientific community realizes what the poor have long told us: harm, perhaps irreversible 
      harm, is being done to the ecosystem. The earth, entire peoples and individual persons are being 
      brutally punished. </p>

         <p><b>And behind all this pain, death and destruction there is the stench of what Basil of Caesarea 
      called "the dung of the devil". An unfettered pursuit of money rules.</b></p>

         <p>The service of the common good is left behind. Once capital becomes an idol and guides people's 
      decisions, once greed for money presides over the entire socioeconomic system, it ruins society,

   <p>Pope Blames Markets for Environment&#39;s Ills </p>

   <p>Pontiff condemns global warming as outgrowth of global consumerism</p>

   <p>Pope Francis said human activity is the cause of climate change, which threatens the poor and 
   future generations.<br>
 </p>

   <p>Updated June 18, 2015 9:46 p.m. ET </p>

   <p>ROME— Pope Francis in his much-awaited encyclical on the environment offered a broad and uncompromising 
   indictment of the global market economy, accusing it of plundering the Earth at the expense of the 
   poor and of future generations.</p>

   <p>In passionate language, the pontiff attributed global warming to human activity, blamed special 
   interests for holding back policy responses and said the global North owes the South &quot;an ecological 
   debt.&quot;</p>

   <p>The 183-page document, which Pope Francis addresses to &quot;every person living on this planet,&quot; includes 
   pointed critiques of globalization and consumerism, which he says lead to environmental degradation.</p>

   <p>&quot;The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,&quot; he writes.</p>

   <p>The encyclical&#39;s severe language stirred immediate controversy, signaling the weight the pontiff&#39;s 
   stance could have on the pitched debate over how to respond to climate change.</p>

   <p>&quot;Economic powers continue to justify the current global system where priority tends to be given 
   to speculation and the pursuit of financial gain,&quot; he writes. &quot;As a result, whatever is fragile, 
   like the environment, is defenseless before the interests of the deified market, which become the 
   only rule.&quot;</p>

   <p>The Vatican published the document, titled &quot;Laudato Si&quot; (&quot;Be praised&quot;), on Thursday. The official 
   release came three days after the online publication of a leaked version by an Italian magazine.</p>

   <p>The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, had described the leaked Italian text as a 
   draft, but the final document, published in eight languages, differed only in minor ways, while the 
   pope&#39;s main points were identical. An encyclical is considered one of the most authoritative forms 
   of papal writing.</p>

   <p>In the encyclical, Pope Francis wades into the debate over the cause of global warming, lending 
   high-profile support to those who attribute it to human activity.</p>

   <p>A &quot;very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming 
   of the climactic system,&quot; contributing to a &quot;constant rise in the sea level&quot; and an &quot;increase of 
   extreme weather events,&quot; he writes.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p><em>&quot;Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, 
      in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it,&quot; he 
      adds.</em></p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>While acknowledging natural causes for climate change, including volcanic activity and the solar 
   cycle, Pope Francis writes that a &quot;number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming 
   in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, 
   nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.&quot;</p>

   <p>The pontiff goes on to argue that there is &quot;an urgent need&quot; for policies to drastically cut the 
   emission of carbon dioxide and other gases and promote the switch to renewable sources of energy.</p>

<h4>[Jun 23, 2015] <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2015/06/on-missing-minsky.html">On Missing 
Minsky </a></h4>
<blockquote>
   Yes, we miss the late Hy Minsky, especially those of us who knew him, although I cannot claim to 
   be one who knew him very well. But I knew him well enough to have experienced his wry wit and unique 
   perspective. Quite aside from that, it would have been great to have had him around these last few 
   years to comment on what has gone on, with so many invoking his name, even as they have in the end 
   largely ended up studiously ignoring him and relegating him back into an intellectual dustbin of 
   history, or tried to.<p>So, Paul Krugman has a post entitled &quot;The Case of the Missing Minsky,&quot; which 
   in turn comments on comments by Mark Thoma on comments by Gavyn Davis on discussions at a recent 
   IMF conference on macroeconomic policy in light of the events of recent years, with Mark link
   <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2015/06/the-case-of-the-missing-minsky.html">
   http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2015/06/the-case-of-the-missing-minsky.html</a>ing 
   to Krugman&#39;s post. He notes that there seem to be three periods of note: a Minsky period of increasing 
   vulnerability of the financial system to crash before the crash, a Bagehot period during the crash, 
   and a Keynes period after the crash. Krugman argues that, despite a lot of floundering by the IMF 
   economists, we supposedly understand the second two, with his preferred neo-ISLM approach properly 
   explaining the final Keynes period of insufficiently strong recovery due to insufficiently strong 
   aggregate demand stimulus, especially relying on fiscal policy (and while I do not fully buy his 
   neo-ISLM approach, I think he is mostly right about the policy bottom line on this, as would the 
   missing Minsky, I think). He also says that looking at 1960s Diamond-Dybvig models of bank panics 
   sufficiently explain the Bagehot period, and they probably do, given the application to the shadow 
   banking system. However, he grants that existing official models do not sufficiently explain the 
   Minsky period, the runup, how things got so fragile that they could collapse so badly.</p>

   <p>Now I do not strongly disagree with most of this, but I shall make a few further points. The first 
   is that in effect Minsky provided a model and discussion of all three stages, although his model 
   of the Keynes stage is not really all that distinctive and is really just Keynes. But he probably 
   did a better job of discussing the Bagehot stage than did Bagehot, and more detailed, if less formal, 
   than Diamond and Dybvig. I suspect that Bagehot got dragged in by the IMF people because he is so 
   respectable and influential regarding central bank policymaking, given his important 1873 <i>Lombard 
   Street</i>, and I am certainly not going to dismiss the importance of that work. But the essentials 
   of what go on in a panic and crash were well understood and discussed prior to 1873, with Minsky, 
   and Kindlegerger drawing on Minsky in his 1978 <i>Manias, Panics, and Crashes,</i> quoting in particular 
   a completely modern discussion from 1848 by John Stuart Mill (I am tempted to produce the quotation 
   here, but it is rather long; I do so on p. 59 of my 1991 <i>From Catastrophe to Chaos: A General 
   Theory of Economic Discontinuities</i>), which clearly delineates the mechanics and patterns of the 
   crash, using the colorful language of &quot;panic&quot; and &quot;revulsion&quot; along the way. Others preceding Bagehot 
   include the inimitable MacKay in 1852 in his <i>Madness of Crowds</i> book and Marx in Vol. III of
   <i>Capital</i>, although admittedly that was not published until well after Bagehot&#39;s book. </p>

   <p>One can even find such discussions in Cantillon early in the 1700s discussing what went on in 
   the Mississippi and South Sea bubbles, from which he made a lot of money, and then, good old Adam 
   Smith in 1776 in WoN (pp. 703-704), who in regard to the South Sea bubble and the managers of the 
   South Sea company declared, &quot;They had an immense capital dividend among an immense number of proprietors. 
   It was naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and profusion should prevail 
   in the whole management of their affairs. The knavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing operations 
   are sufficiently known [as are] the negligence, profusion and malversation of the servants of the 
   company.&quot;</p>

   <p>It must be admitted that this quote from Smith does not have the sort of detailed analysis of 
   the crash itself that one finds in Mill or Bagehot, much less Minsky or Diamond and Dybvig. But there 
   is another reason of interest now to note these inflammatory remarks by Smith. David Warsh in his 
   Economic Principals has posted in the last few days on &quot;Just before the lights went up,&quot; also linked 
   to by the
   <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2015/06/links-for-06-01-15.html">inimitable 
   Mark Thoma</a>. Warsh discusses recent work on Smith&#39;s role in the bailout of the Ayr Bank of Scotland, 
   whose crash in 1772 created macroeconomic instability and layoffs, with Smith apparently playing 
   a role in getting the British parliament to bail out the bank, with its main owners, Lord Buccleuch 
   and the Duke of Queensbury, paying Smith off with a job as Commissioner of Customs afterwards. I 
   had always thought that it was ironic that free trader Smith ended his career in this position, but 
   had not previously known how he got it. As it is, Warsh points out that the debate over bubbles and 
   what the role of government should be in dealing with them was a difference between Smith and his 
   fellow Scottish rival, Sir James Steuart, whose earlier book provided an alternative overview of 
   political economy, now largely forgotten by most <i>(An Inquiry into the Principles of Political 
   Oeconomy</i>, 1767)<i>.</i></p>

   <p>I conclude this by noting that part of the problem for Krugman and also the IMF crowd with Minsky 
   is that it is indeed hard to fit his view into a nice formal model, with various folks (including 
   Mark Thoma) wishing it were to be done and noting that it probably involves invoking the dread behavioral 
   economics that does not provide nice neat models. I also suspect that some of these folks, including 
   Krugman, do not like some of the purveyors of formal models based on Minsky, notably Steve Keen, 
   who has been very noisy in his criticism of these folks, leading even such observers as Noah Smith, 
   who might be open to such things, to denounce Keen for his general naughtiness and to dismiss his 
   work while slapping his hands. But, aside from what Keen has done, I note that there are other ways 
   to model the missing Minsky more formally, including using agent-based models, if one really wants 
   to, these do not involve putting financial frictions into DSGE models, which indeed do not successfully 
   model the missing Minsky.</p>

   <p>Update: Correction from comments is that the Ayr Bank was not bailed out. It failed. However, 
   the two dukes who were its main owners were effectively bailed out, see comments or the original 
   Warsh piece for details. It remains the case that Adam Smith helped out with that and was rewarded 
   with the post of Commissioner of Customs in Scotland.

      What, exactly, is the value added of formal (or even informal) &quot;models&quot; in all this?<p>That is 
      to say, if a historian were to describe the events and responses outlined above, what would he 
      leave out that an economist would put in?</p>

      <p>Keep in mind, there are an infinite number of models that fit the data. Science requires more 
      that a fit. It requires that the model correspond with reality in a way that it can fill in observable 
      data before it is observed. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Simon Wren-Lewis dismisses the policy-maker who listens to the historian as using 
      mere &quot;intelligent guess work&quot;, strongly suggesting that economists clearly do better. But if trying 
      to figure out whether the current moments is Minsky, Keynes or even Keen, isn&#39;t &quot;guesswork&quot; then 
      I don&#39;t know what is. Put &quot;intelligent guess work&quot; policy next to model guided policy in your 
      history above. Where&#39;s the value added from modeling? It has to be useful AND the policy maker 
      must have a scientific reason for knowing it will be useful IN REAL TIME.</p>

      <p>Krugman frequently defends &quot;textbook&quot; modeling with a &quot;nobody else has come up with anything 
      better&quot; response. But that&#39;s a classic &quot;when did you stop beating your wife&quot;. </p>

      <p>What if the economy can&#39;t be modeled? Claiming to do the impossible is deluded, even if you 
      can correctly say: &quot;no one has ever improved upon my method of doing the impossible.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;But we have learned so much!&quot; People say that, but what, exactly, are they talking about?

      was criticized for failing to explain the distance of the planets from the sun. The Aristotelian 
      tradition said that a proper theory of the heavens would do this. </p>

      <p>And so Keynes has his Aristotelian interpreter Hicks and Minsky has his Keen. Requiring the 
      revolution to succeed in doing the impossible means that the truth gets misinterpreted or ignored. 
      Either way, no revolution despite every generation producing a revolutionary that sees the truth.

      <p>What is the value of this theory? If true, it explains how economics can be filled with smart

      I get the impression that mainstream economists are generally resistant to any kind of boom-and-bust 
      models (at least while getting a BA in econ I was never taught any). Is this the case? It&#39;s too 
      bad, because models like Lotka–Volterra are not that hard. Just from messing around with agent-based 
      models it seems like anything with a lag or learning generates cycles. Is it because economists 
      are fixated on optimization and equilibrium? Are they worried about models that are too sensitive 
      to initial conditions?

   <blockquote>
      Thornton,<p>Maybe they should not be, but the discussion among IMF economists, Davis, Thoma, and 
      Krugman has involved models, and in particular, conventional models. So, Krugman declares that 
      there are conventional models as noted above to cover two of the stages, the latter two, but not 
      the first one identified with Minsky. I think there are better models for all this, but they are 
      not the conventional ones.</p>

      <p>chrismealy,</p>

      <p>The DSGE and other conventional models are able to model booms and busts, although they generally 
      do not use the Lotka-Volterra models that such people as the late Richard Goodwin (and even Paul 
      Samuelson) have used for modeling business cycle dynamics. The big difference is that the conventional 
      models involve exogenous shocks to set off their busts, with cyclical reverberations that decay 
      then following the exogenous shock, with some of the lag mechanisms operating for that.</p>

      <p>It is not really surprising that this sort of thing does not model Minsky or the Minsky moment, 
      which involve endogenous dynamics, the very success of the boom as during the Great Moderation 
      itself undermining the stability and even resilience of the system as essentially endogenous psychological 
      (and hence behavioral) factors operate to loosen requirements for lending and to use Minksy language, 
      lending and borrowing increasingly involves highly leveraged Ponzi schemes (and I note that some 
      more conventional economists have emphasized leverage cycles, notably John Geanakoplis, although 
      avoiding Minsky per se in doing so). </p>

   <blockquote>
      This is a good post snd discussion so far. So here&#39;s my $.02:<p>1. Maybe the behaviorists like 
      Thaler have already explored this, but it seems to me that economists still need to learn learning 
      theory from psychologists. Most importantly, &quot;bservational learning,&quot; { http://psychology.about.com/od/oindex/fl/What-Is-Observational-Learning.htm 
      ), or more simply &quot;monkey see, monkey do.&quot; We constantly learn by observing behavior in others: 
      our parents, our older siblings, the cool kids at school, our favorite pop icons, our professors, 
      our business mentors, and so on. As to which,</p>

      <p>2. Some people are better at learning than others (duh!). Some learn right away, some more 
      slowly, some never at all. And further,</p>

      <p>3. Some people are more persceptive than others, recognizing the importance of something earlier 
      or later. If you recognized how important the trend change was when Volcker broke the back of 
      inflation in the early 1980s, and simply bought 30 year treasuries and held them to maturity, 
      you made a killing. If you discovered that in the early 1990s, you made less. And so on.</p>

      <p>All we need, to pick up on chrismealy&#39;s comment, are time periods and learning. Incorporate 
      variations in skill and persceptiveness into the population, and you can get a nice boom and bust 
      model. As more and more people, with various levels of skill, learn an economic behavior (flipping 
      houses, using leverage), they will &quot;push the edge of the envelope&quot; more and more -- does 2x leverage 
      work? Yes, then how about 4x? Yes, then how about 20x? -- until the system is overwhelmed.</p>

      <p>4. But if you don&#39;t want to incorporate imitative learning models from psychology, how about 
      just using appraisals of short term vs. long term risk and reward. Suppose it is the 1980s, and 
      I think treasury yields are on a securlar downtrend. But this book called &quot;Bankruptcy 1995&quot; just 
      came out, based on a blue ribbon panel Reagan created to look at budget deficits. That best selling 
      book forecasts a &quot;hockey stick&quot; of exploding interest rates by the mid-1990s due to ever increasing 
      US debt. So let&#39;s say I am 50% sure of my belief that treasury yields will continue to decline 
      for another 20 years, and I can make 10% a year if I am right. But if I am wrong .....</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, I calculate that there is an 80% chance I can make 10% a year for the next few years 
      by investing in this new publicly traded company named &quot;Microsoft.&quot;</p>

      <p>Even leaving aside behavioral finance theories about loss aversion, it&#39;s pretty clear that 
      most investors will plump for Microsoft over treasuries, given their relative confidence in short 
      term outcomes.</p>

      <p>Historically, once interest rates went close to zero at the outset of the Great Depression, 
      they stayed there for 20 years, and then gradually rose for another 30. How confident are investors 
      that the same scenario will play out this time?</p>

      <p>Either or both of the learning theory or the short term-long term risk reward scenario are 
      good explanations for why backwards induction ad absurdum isn&#39;t an accurate description of behavior.</p>

      <p>----</p>

      <p>BTW, a nice example of a failed &quot;backwards induction&quot; is the &quot;taper tantrum&quot; of 2013. Since 
      investors knew that the Fed was going to be raising interest rates sooner or later, they piled 
      on and raised interest rates immediately -- and made a nice intermediate term top at 3%. </p>

      To New Deal Dem and reason,<p>Sorry, I am not on board with this at all. Sure, I am all for incorporating 
      learning and lags. No problem. This is good old adaptive expectations, which I have no problem 
      with.</p>

      <p>The problem is back to what I said earlier, that Minsky&#39;s apparatus operates endogenously without 
      any need for exogenous shocks, although it can certainly operate within those, as his quoting 
      of Mill shows, although I did not provide that quote, but Mill starts his story of how bubbles 
      happen with some exogenous initial supply/demand shock in a market.</p>

      <p>Why is what you guys talk about an exogenous shock model? Look at the example: Volcker does 
      something and then different people figure it out at different rates. But Volcker is the exogenous 
      shocker. If he does nothing, nothing happens.</p>

      <p>In Minsky world, there does not need to be an exogenous shock. The system may be in a total 
      anf full equilibrium,, but that equilibrium will disequilibrate itself as psychological attitudes 
      and expectations endogenously change due to it. This is what the standard modelers have sush a 
      problem with and do not like. They have no problem wiht adaptive expectations models. This is 
      all old hat stuff for them, with only the fact that one does not know for sure what all those 
      lags are being the problem, and what opened the door to the victory of ratex because it said there 
      are no lags and thus no problem. Agents now what will be on average. </p>

      Warsh&#39;s history of the Ayr Bank has errors. The Bank of England offered it a &quot;bailout&quot; in 1772 
      but required the personal guarantees of the two Dukes which were not forthcoming. The Ayr Bank 
      struggled on without lender of last resort support until August 1773, when it closed for good. 
      (This is all in Clapham&#39;s history of the Bank of England.)

      <p>What Warsh is calling a &quot;bailout&quot; was not a bailout of the bank, but of its proprietors who 
      had unlimited liability and were facing the possibility of putting their estates on the market 
      (which would have affected land prices in Scotland).</p>

      <p>As I understand Warsh&#39;s description, Parliament granted the two Dukes a charter for a limited 
      liability company that would sell annuities. It is entirely possible that contemporary sources 
      would describe such an action as &quot;indemnifying&quot; the promoters of the company. But what is meant 
      by this use of the term is only that Parliament authorized the formation of corporation. The actual 
      indemnity is provided in the event the corporation fails by the members of the public who are 
      creditors of the corporation.</p>

      <p>In short, it is an error to claim that there was a &quot;bailout&quot; of the Ayr Bank. </p>

      Comment on &#39;On Missing Minsky&#39;<p>Since Adam Smith economists have told rather enthralling stories

      However, when it comes to how all this fits into economic theory things become a bit awkward. 
      Of course, we have some modls -- Minsky, Diamond-Dybvig, Keynes come to mind -- but we could also 
      think of other modls -- more agent-based or equilibrium with friction perhaps. On closer inspection, 
      though, economists have no clue at all.</p>

      <p>Keynes messed up the basics of macro with this faulty syllogism: &quot;Income = value of output 
      = consumption + investment. Saving = income - consumption. Therefore saving = investment.&quot; (1973, 
      p. 63)</p>

      <p>From I=S all variants of IS-LM models are derived including Krugman&#39;s neo-ISLM which allegedly 
      explains the post-crash Keynes period. Let there be no ambiguity, all these models have always 
      been conceptually and formally defective (2011).</p>

      <p>Minsky built upon Keynes but not on I=S.<br>
      &quot;The simple equation &#39;profit equals investment&#39; is the fundamental relation for a macroeconomics 
      that aims to determine the behavior through time of a capitalist economy with a sophisticated, 
      complex financial structure.&quot; (Minsky, 2008, p. 161)</p>

      <p>Here profit comes in but neither Minsky, nor Keynes, nor Krugmann, nor Keen, nor the rest of 
      the profession can tell the fundamental difference between income and profit (2014).</p>

      <p>The fact of the matter is that the representative economist fails to capture the essence of 
      the market economy. This does not matter much as long as he has models and stories about crashing 
      Ponzi schemes and bank panics. Yes, eventually we will miss them all -- these inimitable proto-scientific 
      storytellers.</p>

      <p>To have any number of incoherent models is not such a good thing as most economists tend to 
      think. What is needed is the true theory.</p>

      <p>&quot;In order to tell the politicians and practitioners something about causes and best means, 
      the economist needs the true theory or else he has not much more to offer than educated common 
      sense or his personal opinion.&quot; (Stigum, 1991, p. 30)</p>

      <p>The true theory of financial crises presupposes the correct profit theory which is missing 
      since Adam Smith. After this disqualifying performance nobody should expect that some Walrasian 
      or Keynesian bearer of hope will come up with the correct modl any time soon.</p>

      Prof. Rosser:<p>In addition to my hypo re Volcker and interest rates, I also mention flipping 
      houses and leverage. </p>

      <p>Person A flips a house, makes $100k. Person B learns of it, figures s/he can do just as well, 
      and flips a house. Eventually enough people are doing it that news stories are written about it. 
      By now 1000s of people are figuring, &quot;if they can do it, I can do it.&quot;:</p>

      <p>So long as the trend continues, the person using financial leverage to flip houses makes even 
      more profit. Person B uses more leverage, and so on. And since 2x leverage worked, why not 4x 
      leverage. And if that works, why not 10x leverage?</p>

      <p>Both the number of people engaging in the behavior, and the financial leveraging of the behavior, 
      are endogenous, unless you are going to hang your hat on existing trend (note, not necessarily 
      a shock - of rising house prices0.</p>

      <p>All you need is more and more people of various skill sets at various entry points of time 
      engaging in the behavior, and testing increasing leverage the more the behavior works.</p>

      <p>Secondly, as to stability breeding instability, stability itself is the existing trend. Increasingly 
      over time, more and more leverage will be used to profit off the existing trend. All it takes 
      is learning + risk-takers successfully testing the existing limits. The more stable the system, 
      the more risk-takers can apply leverage without rupturing it -- for a while. </p>

   <blockquote>
      Let me try to express my position as a series of axioms:<br>
      1. Assume that no system, no matter how stable, can withstand infinite leverage.<br>
      2. Assume that there is a certain non-zero percentage of risk-taking individuals.<br>
      3. Assume that risk-takers will use some amount of leverage to attempt to profit within a stable 
      system.<br>
      4. Assume that risk-takers will use increasing leverage once any given lesser percentage of leverage 
      succeeds in rendering a profit, in order to increase profits.<br>
      5. Assume that others will learn, over various time periods, at varying levels of skill, to imitate 
      the successful behavior of risk-takers.<p>Under those circumstances, it is certain that any system, 
      no matter how stable, will ultimately succumb to leverage. And the more stable, the more leverage 
      will have been applied to reach that breaking point. I.e., stability breeds instability. </p>

   <blockquote>
      Even using history as an analogy is implicitly introducing a model. You&#39;re saying, here&#39;s my model 
      of this history and I crank my little model to show the behavior of the model simulates the historical 
      record, then I adapt the model to present circumstances, and crank again arguing, again by analogy.<br>
      .<br>
      What I would object to is the reliance on &quot;<i>analytic</i> models&quot; as opposed to operational models 
      of the actual institutions. Economists love their analytic models, particularly axiomatic deductive 
      &quot;nomological machines&quot;, DSGE being the current orthodox approach. Not that there is anything wrong 
      about analysis. My objection would be to basing policy advice on a study of analytic models to 
      the exclusion of all else -- Krugman&#39;s approach -- rather than an empirical study of institutions 
      in operation (which would still involve models, because that&#39;s how people think, but they might 
      be, for example, simulation models calibrated to observed operational mechanisms). <br>
      .<br>
      There are reasons why economists prefer analytic models, but few of those reasons are sound. In 
      the end, it is a matter of bad judgment fostered by a defective education and corruption or weakmindedness. 
      Among other things, reliance on analytic models give economics an esoteric quality that privileges 
      its elite practitioners. Ordinary people can barely understand what Krugman is talking about in 
      the referenced piece, and that&#39;s by design. He does his bit to protect the reputations of folks 
      like Bernanke and Blanchard, obscuring their viewpoints and the consequences of their policies.<br>
      .<br>
      I am not sure what can be done about it. Economists like Krugman are as arrogant as they are ignorant 
      -- there&#39;s not enough intellectual integrity to even acknowledge fundamental errors, and that 
      lack of integrity keeps the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; going in the face of manifest failures. For the conservatives 
      on some payroll, the problem is even worse.<br>
      .<br>
      I am not confident that shooing economists from the policy room and encouraging politicians to 
      discuss these matters among themselves improves the situation. In doubt, people fall back on a 
      moral fundamentalism of the kind that gets us to &quot;austerity&quot; and &quot;sacrifice&quot; and blames the victims 
      -- pretty much what we have now.<br>
      .<br>
      Re-doing Minsky as an analytic model is an impossible task almost by definition. Minsky&#39;s approach 
      was fundamentally about abstracting from careful observation of what financial firms did, operationally. 
      It made him a hero with many financial sector denizens, who recognized themselves in his narratives, 
      even when he cast them in the role of bad guys. (No one is ever going to recognize himself as 
      a representative agent in a DSGE model.)<br>
      .<br>
      Perhaps the hardest thing to digest from Minsky is the insight that business cycles can not be 
      entirely mastered. The economy is fundamentally a set of disequilibrium phenomena, the instability 
      built-in (endogenous, as they say). The New Keynesian idea is that the economy is fundamentally 
      an equilibrium phenomenon, that occasionally needs a helping hand to recover from exogenous disturbance. 
      These are antagonistic world views, which cannot be reconciled with each other, and the New Keynesian 
      view can be reconciled only minimally with the observable facts of the world, by a lot of ad hoc 
      fuzzy thinking (&quot;frictions&quot;).<br>
      .<br>
      It&#39;s very ugly.

      Bruce, I disagree with your view of politicians. The current GOP crop are essentially following 
      the moral philosophy that, in the end, is the only content generated by economics. But it was 
      not always thus.

      <p>I once watched Senator Kit Bond of Missouri (very-R) try to round up a quorum in the Small 
      Business Committee. It was quite clear that the man enjoyed people. He liked the company of just 
      about everybody. Without the strong interference from economists, that&#39;s who ends up in politics. 
      People like that are pragmatic. They try things. They aren&#39;t there for the purpose (contra Ted 
      Cruz) of breaking things. </p>

      <p>You&#39;re right, my problem really is with analytic &quot;models&quot; which aren&#39;t really models but rather 
      metaphors or analogies. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only way reasoning from history can work.
      </p>

      <p>There are lots of areas of policy, some of which continue to resist conversion to economic 
      religion. In education policy we try interventions and see what happens. It&#39;s inductive and mostly 
      correlation, but thru trial and error we do progress toward better policy (although schools of 
      education are only slowly moving away from their notoriously anti-scientific past).</p>

      <p>Politicians don&#39;t have to think about the budget like a household and tighten belts. They know 
      that business borrow money all the time. It&#39;s actually the language of the academy that leads 
      to &quot;tightening belts&quot; instead of investing in the future. Economics is the science of claiming 
      that if you need something, and you can afford that something, you still must consider &quot;multipliers&quot; 
      or &quot;the philosophers stone&quot; or some other nonsense before you can decide to buy what you need.

      Barkley,<br>
      I think I should clarify, I think endogenous and exogenous are a little bit besides the point 
      here. I think the exact trigger that starts a &quot;state change&quot; in the system has a stochastic component. 
      But the increasing vulnerability of the system is endogenous, in a very Minsky sense. What I am 
      saying is that increasing vulnerability could be modelled without using agent based modelling 
      (a bit like modelling landslides or earthquakes if you like). I&#39;m not saying that the model is 
      just being driven by exogenous shocks.<p>Bruce,<br>
      I think there is a bit of tendency to mischaracterise what Paul Krugman is saying. He is the last 
      person you should be accusing of mistaking the map for the territory. He is saying that EVEN relatively 
      simple models can make sensible suggestions about policy in some circumstances.</p>

      <p>Yes, though I tend to agree with you that general equilibrium is the original sin in macro-economic 
      modelling and that the system is in fact a disequilibrium system. But that doesn&#39;t imply to me 
      at all that you can&#39;t use analytical approaches. </p>

   article</a> entitled &quot;Championing Environment, Francis Takes Aim at Global Capitalism&quot; quotes a conventional 
   Harvard economist, Robert N. Stavins. Stavins is enraged by Pope Francis&#39; position on the environment 
   because the Pope is &quot;opposed to the world economic order.&quot; The rage, unintentionally, reveals why 
   conventional economics is the most dangerous ideology pretending to be a &quot;science.&quot;</p>

   <p>Stavins&#39; attacks on the Pope quickly became personal and dismissive. This is odd, for Pope Francis&#39; 
   positions on the environment are the same as Stavins&#39; most important positions. Stavins&#39; natural 
   response to the Pope&#39;s views on the environment – had Stavin not been an economist – would have been 
   along the lines of &quot;Pope Francis is right, and we urgently need to make his vision a reality.&quot;</p>

   <p>Stavins&#39; fundamental position is that there is an urgent need for a &quot;radical restructuring&quot; of 
   the markets to prevent them from causing a global catastrophe. That is Pope Francis&#39; fundamental 
   position. But Stavins ends up mocking and trying to discredit the Pope.</p>

   <p>I was struck by the similarity of Stavins response to Pope Francis to the rich man&#39;s response 
   to Jesus. The episode is reported in Matthew, Mark, and Luke in similar terms. I&#39;ll use Matthew&#39;s 
   version (KJAV), which begins at 19:16 with the verse:</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may 
      have eternal life?</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Jesus responds:</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but 
      if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>The young rich man wants to know which commandments he needs to follow to gain eternal life.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, 
      Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</p>

      <p>Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

      <p>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>The young, wealthy man is enthused. The Rabbi that he believes has the secret of eternal life 
   has agreed to personally answer his question as to how to obtain it. He passes the requirements the 
   Rabbi lists, indeed, he has met those requirements since he was a child.</p>

   <p>But then Jesus lowers the boom in response to the young man&#39;s question on what he &quot;lacks.&quot;</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, 
      and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>We need to &quot;review the bidding&quot; at this juncture. The young man is wealthy. He believes that Jesus 
   knows the secret to obtaining eternal life. His quest was to discover – and comply – with the requirement 
   to achieve eternal life. The Rabbi has told him the secret – and then gone well beyond the young 
   man&#39;s greatest hopes by offering to make him a disciple. The door to eternal life is within the young 
   man&#39;s power to open. All he needs to do is give all that he owns to the poor. The Rabbi goes further 
   and offers to make the young man his disciple. In exchange, the young man will secure &quot;treasure in 
   heaven&quot; – eternal life and a place of particular honor for his sacrifice and his faith in Jesus.</p>

   <p>Jesus&#39; answer – the answer the young man thought he wished to receive more than anything in the 
   world – the secret of eternal life, causes the young man great distress.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>The young man rejects eternal life because he cannot bear the thought of giving his &quot;great possessions&quot; 
   to &quot;the poor.&quot; Notice that the young man is not evil. He keeps the commandments. He is eager to do 
   a &quot;good thing&quot; to gain eternal life. He has &quot;great possessions&quot; and is eager to trade a generous 
   portion of his wealth as a good deed to achieve eternal life. In essence, he is seeking to purchase 
   an indulgence from Jesus.</p>

   <p>But Jesus&#39; response causes the young, wealthy man to realize that he must make a choice. He must 
   decide which he loves more – eternal life or his great possessions. He is &quot;sorrowful&quot; for Jesus&#39; 
   response causes him to realize that he loves having his great possessions for his remaining span 
   of life on earth more than eternal life itself.</p>

   <p>Jesus offers him not only the means to open the door to eternal life but the honor of joining 
   him as a disciple. The young man is forced by Jesus&#39; offer to realize that his wealth has so fundamentally 
   changed him that he will voluntarily give up his entry into eternal life. He is not simply &quot;sorrowful&quot; 
   that he will not enter heaven – he is &quot;sorrowful&quot; to realize that heaven is open to him – but he 
   will refuse to enter it because of his greed. His wealth has become a golden trap of his own creation 
   that will damn him. The golden bars of his cell are invisible and he can remove them at any time 
   and enter heaven, but the young man realizes that his greed for his &quot;great possessions&quot; has become 
   so powerful that his self-created jail cell has become inescapable. It is only when Jesus opens the 
   door to heaven that the young man realizes for the first time in his life how completely his great 
   possessions have corrupted and doomed him. He knows he is committing the suicide of his soul – and 
   that he is powerless to change because he has been taught to value his own worth as a person by the 
   extent of his great possessions.</p>

   <p>Jesus then makes his famous saying that captures the corrupting effects of great wealth.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter 
      into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

      <p>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than 
      for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>The remainder of the passage is of great importance to Luther&#39;s doctrine of &quot;justification by 
   faith alone&quot; and leads to Jesus&#39; famous discussion of why &quot;the last shall be first,&quot; (in which his 
   anti-market views are made even more explicit) but the portions I have quoted are adequate to my 
   purpose.</p>

   <p>Pope Francis&#39; positions on the environment and climate are the greatest boon that Stavin has received 
   in decades. The Pope, like Stavins, tells us that climate change is a disaster that requires urgent 
   governmental action to fix. Stavins could receive no more joyous news. Instead of being joyous, however, 
   Stavins is sorrowful. Indeed, unlike the wealthy man who simply leaves after hearing the Rabbi&#39;s 
   views, Stavins rages at and heaps scorn on the prelate, Pope Francis. Stavins&#39; email to the <em>New 
   York Times </em>about the Pope&#39;s position on climate change contains this double ideological smear.</p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>The approach by the pope, an Argentine who is the first pontiff from the developing world, 
      is similar to that of a &quot;small set of socialist Latin American countries that are opposed to the 
      world economic order, fearful of free markets, and have been utterly dismissive and uncooperative 
      in the international climate negotiations,&quot; Dr. Stavins said.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>Stavins&#39; work explicitly states that the &quot;free markets&quot; he worships are causing &quot;mass extinction&quot; 
   and a range of other disasters. Stavins&#39; work explicitly states that the same &quot;free markets&quot; are 
   incapable of change – they cause incentives so perverse that they are literally suicidal – and the 
   markets are incapable of reform even when they are committing suicide by <em>laissez faire. </em>
   That French term is what Stavins uses to describe our current markets. Pope Francis agrees with each 
   of these points.</p>

   <p>Pope Francis says, as did Jesus, that this means that we must not worship &quot;free markets,&quot; that 
   we must think first of the poor, and that justice and fairness should be our guides to proper conduct. 
   Stavins, like the wealthy young man, is forced to make a choice. He chooses &quot;great possessions.&quot; 
   Unlike the wealthy young man, however, Stavins is enraged rather than &quot;sorrowful&quot; and Stavins lashes 
   out at the religious leader. He is appalled that an Argentine was made Pope, for Pope Francis holds 
   views &quot;that are opposed to the world economic order [and] fearful of free markets.&quot; Well, yes. A 
   very large portion of the world&#39;s people oppose &quot;the Washington Consensus&quot; and want a very different 
   &quot;world economic order.&quot; Most of the world&#39;s top religious leaders are strong critics of the &quot;world 
   economic order.&quot;</p>

   <p>As to being &quot;fearful of free markets,&quot; Stavins&#39; own work shows that his use of the word &quot;free&quot; 
   in that phrase is not simply meaningless, but false. Stavins explains that the people, animals, and 
   plants that are the imminent victims of &quot;mass extinction&quot; have no ability in the &quot;markets&quot; to protect 
   themselves from mass murder. They are &quot;free&quot; only to become extinct, which makes a mockery of the 
   word &quot;free.&quot;</p>

   <p>Similarly, Stavins&#39; work shows that any sentient species would be &quot;fearful&quot; of markets that Stavins 
   proclaims are literally suicidal and incapable of self-reform. Stavins writes that only urgent government 
   intervention that forces a &quot;radical restructuring&quot; of the markets can save our planet from &quot;mass 
   extinction.&quot; When I read that I believed that he was &quot;fearful of free markets.&quot;</p>

   <p>We have all had the experience of seeing the &quot;free markets&quot; blow up the global economy as recently 
   as 2008. We saw there, as well, that only massive government intervention could save the markets 
   from a global meltdown. Broad aspects of the financial markets became dominated by our three epidemics 
   of &quot;accounting control fraud.&quot;</p>

   <p>Stavins is appalled that a religious leader could oppose a system based on the pursuit and glorification 
   of &quot;great possessions.&quot; He is appalled that a religious leader is living out the Church&#39;s mission 
   to provide a &quot;preferential option for the poor.&quot; Stavins hates the Church&#39;s mission because it is 
   &quot;socialist&quot; – and therefore so obviously awful that it does not require refutation by Stavins. This 
   cavalier dismissal of religious beliefs held by most humans is revealing coming from a field that 
   proudly boasts the twin lies that it is a &quot;positive&quot; &quot;science.&quot; Theoclassical economists embrace 
   an ideology that is antithetical to nearly every major religion.</p>

   <p>Stavins, therefore, refuses to enter the door that Pope Francis has opened. Stavins worships a 
   system based on the desire to accumulate &quot;great possessions&quot; – even though he knows that the markets 
   pose an existential threat to most species on this planet and even though he knows that his dogmas 
   increasingly aid the worst, most fraudulent members of our society to become wealthy through forms 
   of &quot;looting&quot; (Akerlof and Romer 1993) that make other people poorer. The result is that Stavins denounces 
   Pope Francis rather than embracing him as his most valuable ally.</p>

   <p><strong>Conclusion: Greed and Markets Kill: Suicide by <em>Laissez Faire</em></strong></p>

   <p>The old truths remain. The worship of &quot;great possessions&quot; wreaks such damage on our humanity that 
   we come to love them more than life itself and act in a suicidal fashion toward our species and as 
   mass destroyers of other species. Jesus&#39; insight was that this self-corruption is so common, so subtle, 
   and so powerful that &quot;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich 
   man to enter into the kingdom of God.&quot; Today, he would probably use &quot;economist&quot; rather than &quot;camel.&quot;</p>

   <p>Theoclassical economists are the high priests of this celebration of greed that Stavins admits 
   poses the greatest threat to life on our planet. When Pope Francis posed a choice to Stavins, he 
   chose to maintain his dogmatic belief in a system that he admits is suicidal and incapable of self-reform. 
   The reason that the mythical and mystical &quot;free markets&quot; that Stavins worships are suicidal and incapable 
   of self-reform even when they are producing &quot;mass extinction&quot; is that the markets are a system based 
   on greed and the desire to obtain &quot;great possessions&quot; even if the result is to damn us and life on 
   our planet.</p>

   <p>Adam Smith propounded the paradox that greed could lead the butcher and baker (in a village where 
   everyone could judge reputation and quality) to reliably produce goods of high quality at the lowest 
   price. The butcher and baker, therefore, would act (regardless of their actual motivations) as if 
   they cared about their customers. Smith observed that the customer of small village merchant&#39;s products 
   would find the merchant&#39;s self-interest a more reliable assurance of high quality than the merchant&#39;s 
   altruism.</p>

   <p>But Stavins makes clear in his writing that this is not how markets function in the context of 
   &quot;external&quot; costs to the environment. In the modern context, the energy markets routinely function 
   in a manner that Stavins rightly depicts as leading to mass murder. Stavins so loves the worship 
   of the quest for &quot;great possessions&quot; that he is eager to try to discredit Pope Francis as a leader 
   in the effort to prevent &quot;mass extinction&quot; (Stavins&#39; term) – suicide by <em>laissez faire.</em></p>

   <p>(No, I am not now and never was or will be a Catholic.)</p>

   <blockquote>

      <p>The Pope&#39;s recent comments stirred an old memory from when I was a child, for some reason. 
      Growing up in England in the 1980&#39;s, it didn&#39;t escape even my childish notice that the series 
      &quot;Dr. Who&quot; was often a vehicle for what would now been deemed outrageously left wing thinking and 
      ideas.</p>

      <p>One such episode was
      <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/pirateplanet/detail.shtml">
      The Pirate Planet</a>. The plot&#39;s premise was that a race had created a mechanism for consuming 
      entire planets at a time, extracting mineral wealth from the doomed planet being destroyed in 
      the process and using energy and resources for the benefit of a tiny ruling elite with the remnants 
      being offered as trinkets for the masses. </p>

      <p>A small subset of the evil race was subliminally aware of what was happening. One of the lines 
      spoken by a character really stuck in my mind, when he said after the reality of their existence 
      was explained to him &quot;so… people die… to make us rich?&quot;</p>

      <p>At the time, it was intended I think more as an allegory on the exploitation of South African 
      gold miners under apartheid than as a general critique of capitalism by the prevailing socialist 
      thinking in Britain in that era (it seems impossible now for me to believe how left wing Britain 
      was in the late 1970s and even into the very early 1980s, but that is indeed the case; it feels 
      like it was a completely different country. Perhaps it was…). No wonder the Thatcher government 
      aggressively targeted the BBC (who produced the show), seeing it, probably rightly, as a hotbed 
      of Trotskyite ideology. </p>

      <p>But the point the show was trying to make is as valid now as it was then and is the same point 
      the Pope Francis is making. A great deal of our material wealth and affluence is built on others&#39; 
      suffering. It is wrong. And the system which both perpetrates the suffering and the people who 
      benefit from it needs to change. Us turkeys are going to have to vote for Christmas.</p>

      and that their set of values is the only set of values even worth considering (TINA). The Pope&#39;s 
      job is to remind us all of another possible set of values and organizing principles. No one said

         incapable of self-reform. The reason that the mythical and mystical &quot;free markets&quot; that Stavins 
         worships are suicidal and incapable of self-reform even when they are producing &quot;mass extinction&quot; 
         is that the markets are a system based on greed and the desire to obtain &quot;great possessions&quot; 
         even if the result is to damn us and life on our planet.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is an extremely important point. We cannot combat neoliberal ideology as if it were simply 
      a set of rational assumptions, albeit flowing from flawed premises. No, it is a <strong>religious 
      dogma</strong> of greed, set up to combat all of the more communitarian and gentle schools of 
      religious thought– including the Christianity of Pope Francis, or the environmentalism of St. 
      Francis, the patron saint of ecologists.</p>

</a><a>George Monbiot</a></h4>

<blockquote>
	
	<p>
	Pope Francis reminds us that our relationship to the natural world is about love, not just goods 
	and services </p>

	<p>Who wants to see the living world destroyed? Who wants an end to birdsong, bees and coral reefs, 
	the falcon’s stoop, the salmon’s leap? Who wants to see the soil stripped from the land, the sea 
	rimed with rubbish?</p>

	<p>No one. And yet it happens. Seven billion of us allow
	<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground">fossil fuel companies</a> 
	to push shut the narrow atmospheric door through which humanity stepped. We permit industrial farming

	<p>Why are the defenders of the living world so ineffective? It is partly, of course, that everyone 
	is complicit; we have all been swept off our feet by the tide of hyper<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/nov/30/climate-change-limit-excessive-consumption">consumption</a>,

	<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment">
	environmentalism</a> is also afflicted by a deeper failure: arising possibly from embarrassment 
	or fear, a failure of emotional honesty.</p>

						<p>I have asked meetings of green-minded people to raise their hands if they 
						became defenders of nature because they were worried about the state of their 
						bank accounts. Never has one hand appeared. Yet I see the same people base their 
						appeal to others on the argument that they will lose money if we don’t protect 
						the natural world.</p>

	<p>Such claims are factual, but they are also dishonest: we pretend that this is what animates us, 
	when in most cases it does not. The reality is that we care because we love. Nature appealed to 
	our hearts, when we were children, long before it appealed to our heads, let alone our pockets. 
	Yet we seem to believe we can persuade people to change their lives through the cold, mechanical 
	power of reason, supported by statistics.</p>

	<p>I see the

	published on Thursday</a>, as a potential turning point. He will argue that not only the physical 
	survival of the poor, but also our spiritual welfare depends on the protection of the natural world; 
	and in both respects he is right.</p>

	<p>I don’t mean that a belief in God is the answer to our environmental crisis. Among Pope Francis’s 
	opponents is the evangelical US-based Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, which has 
	written to him arguing that we have a holy duty to

	<p>In his beautiful book
	<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="https://www.hodder.co.uk/Books/detail.page?isbn=9781444792775">
	The Moth Snowstorm</a>, Michael McCarthy suggests that a capacity to love the natural world, rather 
	than merely to exist within it, might be a uniquely human trait. When we are close to nature, we 
	sometimes find ourselves, as Christians put it, surprised by joy: “A happiness with an overtone 
	of something more, which we might term an elevated or, indeed, a spiritual quality.”</p>

	<p>He believes we are wired to develop a rich emotional relationship with nature. A large body of 
	research suggests that contact with the living world is essential to our psychological and physiological 
	wellbeing. (<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/15/green-spaces-improve-school-childrens-mental-development-study-finds">A 
	paper published this week</a>, for example, claims that green spaces around city schools improve 
	children’s mental performance.)</p>

	<p>This does not mean that all people love nature; what it means, McCarthy proposes, is that there 
	is a universal propensity to love it, which may be drowned out by the noise that assails our minds. 
	As I’ve found while volunteering with the outdoor education charity Wide Horizons,
	<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/education-children-not-feral-enough">
	this love can be provoked almost immediately</a>, even among children who have never visited the 
	countryside before. Nature, McCarthy argues, remains our home, “the true haven for our psyches”, 
	and retains an astonishing capacity to bring peace to troubled minds.</p>
						<ASIDE class="element element-pullquote">

						<blockquote style="font-style: normal; margin: 0">

							<p>Acknowledging our love for the living world does something that a library

	</blockquote>
						</ASIDE>

						<p>Acknowledging our love for the living world does something that a library 
						full of papers on sustainable development and ecosystem services cannot: it 
						engages the imagination as well as the intellect. It inspires belief; and this 
						is essential to the lasting success of any movement.</p>

	<p>Is this a version of the religious conviction from which Pope Francis speaks? Or could his religion 
	be a version of a much deeper and older love? Could a belief in God be a way of explaining and channelling 
	the joy, the burst of love that nature sometimes inspires in us? Conversely, could the hyperconsumption 
	that both religious and secular environmentalists lament be a response to
	<a title class=" u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/opinion/our-ecological-boredom.html?_r=1">
	ecological boredom</a>: the void that a loss of contact with the natural world leaves in our psyches?</p>

	<p>Of course, this doesn’t answer the whole problem. If the acknowledgement of love becomes the 
	means by which we inspire environmentalism in others, how do we translate it into political change? 
	But I believe it’s a better grounding for action than pretending that what really matters to us 
	is the state of the economy. By being honest about our motivation we can inspire in others the passions 
	that inspire us.

	<p>For those who have decided to only read partial excerpts from the Pope's exhortation, I would 
	also encourage you to understand that the Pope's perspective on poverty is somewhat different 
	than our perspective on poverty.</p>

	<p>In my travels to Haiti, the Caribbean, the Far East, and the Middle East, the true extent of 
	poverty becomes clear. Our perception of poverty, while real for those feeling pain and 
	deprivation, is significantly different than the poverty that the Pope is discussing.</p>

	<p>This does not however alter his message. He is saying that as Catholics we have a 
	responsibility to place our faith above our material goods. Pope Francis is concerned about our 
	salvation, not our bank account. I would have it no other way from my spiritual leader.</p>

	<p>When one places great value in material things, the focus is lost on how you can selflessly 
	help another. This is precisely the image of being a good parent in which the parent is more 
	concerned about their child than they are about themselves. Pope Francis is merely concerned 
	about his flock.<p>
	In a similar vein,
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/jefferson-s-letter-to-the-danbury-baptists">
	Thomas Jefferson</a>, our third president, recognized the great threat in which a government 
	would attempt to be too strongly influenced by a religion. Thomas Jefferson understood that they 
	must be separate, as does Pope Francis.</p>

	<p>The Pope's similarity with Thomas Jefferson is more significant than you may think. In our 
	founding principles, we already were a Judeo-Christian nation guided by our faith individually 
	because of our individual character. The government was influenced by the character of those 
	with faith and not by their religion directly. It is not a government of faith but a government 
	in which its leaders are influenced and guided by their faith.</p>

Just Shut That Pope Up</a> by Patrick J. Deneen </h4>

	<h6>Dec 5, 2013 |
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/would-someone-just-shut-that-pope-up/">The American 
	Conservative</a></h6>
	Since the release of
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html">
	<i>Evangelii Gaudium</i></a> there have been countless articles and commentary about the economic 
	portions of Pope Francis’s Apostolic Exhortation. Some of the commentary has been downright bizarre, 
	such as Rush Limbaugh
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/3/rush-limbaugh-decries-pope-francis-pure-marxism/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS">
	denouncing</a> the Pope as a Marxist, or Stuart Varney
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2013/12/03/foxs-varney-attacks-pope-francis-comments-on-in/197108">
	accusing </a>Francis of being a neo-socialist. American conservatives grumbled but dutifully denounced 
	a distorting media when Pope Francis seemed to go wobbly on homosexuality, but his criticisms of 
	capitalism have crossed the line, and we now see the Pope being criticized and even denounced from 
	nearly every rightward-leaning media pulpit in the land.<p>Not far below the surface of many of 
	these critiques one hears the following refrain: why can’t the Pope just go back to talking about 
	abortion? Why can’t we return the good old days of Pope John Paul II or Benedict XVI and talk 24/7/365 
	about sex? Why doesn’t Francis have the decency to limit himself to talking about Jesus and gays, 
	while avoiding the rudeness of discussing economics in mixed company, an issue about which he has 
	no expertise or competence?</p>

	<p>There are subtle and brash versions of this plea. At “The Catholic Thing,” Hadley Arkes
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.thecatholicthing.org/columns/2013/francis-the-writer-unbound.html">has penned</a> 
	a characteristically elegant essay in which he notes that Francis is generally correct on teachings 
	about marriage and abortion, but touches on these subjects too briefly, cursorily and with unwelcome 
	caveats of sorts. At the same time, Francis goes on at length about the inequalities and harm caused 
	by free market economies, which moves Hadley to counsel the Pope to consult next time with Michael 
	Novak. The upshot—be as brief as the Gettysburg Address in matters pertaining to economics, and 
	loquacious as Edward Everett when it comes to erotics.</p>

	<p>On the brash side there is Larry Kudlow,
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/63309-video-michael-matheson-miller-discusses-evangelii-gaudium-cnbcs-kudlow-report.html">
	who nearly hyperventilates </a>when it comes to his disagreement with Pope Francis, accusing him 
	of harboring sympathies with Communist Russia and not sufficiently appreciating Ronald Reagan, Margaret 
	Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II. (R. R. Reno, who is briefly allowed to get a word in edgewise, 
	wisely counseled Kudlow not to fight the last war—or, the one fought three wars ago, for that matter.) 
	Revealingly, Kudlow counsels the Pope to concentrate on “moral and religious reform,” and that he 
	should “harp” instead on “morality, spiritualism and religiosity,” while ceasing to speak about 
	matters economic. Similarly, Judge Napolitano, responding to a challenge from Stuart Varney on why 
	the Pope is talking about economics, responded: “I wish he would stick to faith and morals, on which 
	he is very sound and traditional.”</p>

	<p>These commentators all but come and out say: we embrace Catholic teaching when it concerns itself 
	with “faith and morals”—when it denounces abortion, opposes gay marriage, and urges personal charity. 
	This is the Catholicism that has been acceptable in polite conversation. This is a stripped-down 
	Catholicism that doesn’t challenge fundamental articles of economic faith.</p>

	<p>And it turns out that this version of Catholicism is a useful tool. It is precisely this portion 
	of Catholicism that is acceptable to those who control the right narrative because it doesn’t truly 
	endanger what’s most important to those who steer the Republic: maintaining an economic system premised 
	upon limitless extraction, fostering of endless desires, and creating a widening gap between winners 
	and losers that is papered over by mantras about
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/05/02/poor-students-are-the-real-victims-of-college-discrimination/">
	favoring equality of opportunity</a>. A massive funding apparatus supports conservative Catholic 
	causes supporting a host of causes—so long as they focus exclusively on issues touching on human 
	sexuality, whether abortion, gay marriage, or religious liberty (which, to be frank, is intimately 
	bound up in its current form with concerns about abortion). It turns out that these funds are a 
	good investment: “faith and morals” allow us to assume the moral high ground and preoccupy the social 
	conservatives while we laugh all the way to the bank bailout.</p>

	<p>The right’s contretemps with Pope Francis has brought out into the open what is rarely mentioned 
	in polite company: most visible and famous Catholics who fight on behalf of Catholic causes in America 
	focus almost exclusively on sexual issues (as Pope Francis himself seemed to be pointing out, and 
	chastising, in <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview">his <em>America</em> interview</a>), 
	but have been generally silent regarding a century-old tradition of Catholic social and economic 
	teaching. The meritocracy and economic elite have been a main beneficiary of this silence: those 
	most serious about Catholicism—and thus who could have brought to bear a powerful tradition of thinking 
	about economics that avoids both the radical individualistic presuppositions of capitalism as well 
	as the collectivism of socialism—have spent their energies fighting the sexual/culture wars, even 
	while Republican-Democratic ruling machine has merely changed driver seat in a limousine that delivers 
	them to<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Belmont---Fishtown-7250"> ever-more exclusive 
	zip codes</a>.</p>

	<p>In the past several months, when discussing Pope Francis, the left press has at every opportunity 
	advanced a “narrative of rupture,” claiming that Francis essentially is
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/09/19/this-extraordinary-pope-ctd/">repudiating nearly 
	everything </a>that Popes JPII and Benedict XVI stood for. The left press and commentariat has celebrated 
	Francis as the anti-Benedict following his impromptu airplane interview (“who am I to judge?”) and 
	lengthy interview with the Jesuit magazine <i>America</i>. However, in these more recent reactions 
	to Francis by the right press and commentariat, we witness extensive agreement by many Catholics 
	regarding the “narrative of rupture,” wishing for the good old days of John Paul II and Benedict 
	XVI.</p>

	<p>But there has been no rupture—neither the one wished for by the left nor feared by the right. 
	Pope Francis has been entirely consistent with those previous two Popes who are today alternatively 
	hated or loved, for Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI spoke with equal force and power against 
	the depredations of capitalism. (JPII in the encyclical
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus_en.html">
	Centesimus Annus</a> and Benedict XVI in the encyclical
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus_en.html">
	Caritas in Veritate.</a>) But these encyclicals—more authoritative than an Apostolic Exhortation—did 
	not provoke the same reaction as Francis’s critiques of capitalism. This is because the dominant 
	narrative about John Paul II and Benedict XVI had them pegged them as, well, Republicans. For the 
	left, they were old conservatives who obsessed with sexual matters; for the right, solid traditionalists 
	who cared about Catholicism’s core moral teachings. Both largely ignored their social and economic 
	teachings, so focused were they on their emphasis on “faith and morals.” All overlooked that, for 
	Catholics, economics is a branch of moral philosophy.</p>

	<p>I think it is because of the left’s “narrative of disruption” that the right is panicked over 
	Francis’s critiques of capitalism. These Vatican criticisms—suddenly salient in ways they weren’t 
	when uttered by JPII and Benedict—need to be nipped in the bud before they do any damage. Of course, 
	all along Catholic teaching has seen a strong tie between the radical individualism and selfishness 
	at the heart of capitalism and liberationist sexual practices, understanding them to be premised 
	on the same anthropological assumptions. (If you don’t believe Catholics about this, just read Ayn 
	Rand.) While Hadley Arkes laments that Pope Francis did not speak at more length on sexual matters, 
	if one reads his criticisms of the depredations of capitalism with care, one notices that he uses 
	the same phrases with which he criticized abortion—namely, that abortion is but one manifestation 
	of “<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1303991.htm">a throw-away culture</a>,” 
	a phrase as well as in <em>Evangelii Gaudium</em> in his critique of capitalism (<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html#No_to_an_economy_of_exclusion">Section 
	53</a>). If one attends carefully to Francis’s criticisms of the economy’s effects on the weak and 
	helpless, one can’t help but perceive there also that he is speaking of the unborn as much as those 
	who are “losers” in an economy that favors the strong. Like John Paul and Benedict before him, Francis 
	discerns the continuity between a “throw-away” economy and a “throw-away” view of human life. He 
	sees the deep underlying connection between an economy that highlights autonomy, infinite choice, 
	loose connections, constant titillation, utilitarianism and hedonism, and a sexual culture that 
	condones random hook-ups, abortion, divorce and the redefinition of marriage based on sentiment, 
	and in which the weak—children, in this case, and those in the lower socio-economic scale who are 
	suffering a complete devastation of the family—are an afterthought.</p>

	<p>The division of the fullness of Catholic thought in America has rendered it largely tractable 
	in a nation that was always suspicious of Catholics. Lockean America tamed Catholicism not by oppression 
	(as Locke thought would be necessary), but by dividing and conquering—permitting and even encouraging 
	promotion of its sexual teachings, albeit shorn of its broader social teachings. This co-opted the 
	full power of those teachings, directing the energy of social conservatives exclusively into the 
	sexual-culture wars while leaving largely untouched a rapacious economy that daily creates
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/two-nations-under-mammon/">few winners and more 
	losers</a> while supporting a culture of sexual license and “throw-away” children. Without minimizing 
	the seriousness with which we need to take issues like abortion, gay marriage, and religious liberty, 
	these are discrete aspects of an overarching “globalization of indifference” described by Francis. 
	However, we have been trained to treat them as a set of autonomous political issues that can be 
	solved by one or two appointments on the Supreme Court. Francis—like JPII and BXVI before him—has 
	upset the “arrangement.” Rush and the gang are not about to go down without a fight. If only they 
	could get that damn Marxist to talk about sex.</div> </p>

	The Guardian</a></h4>
	<a title="More from the Guardian on Pope Francis" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis">
	Pope Francis</a> is a pontiff who has constructively broken all the rules of popery – so far to 
	widespread acclaim. He&#39;s faulted the Catholic church for its
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/pope-francis-gay-priests">negative obsession 
	with gays and birth contro</a>l, and now he has expanded his mandate to economics with a groundbreaking 
	screed denouncing &quot;<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/pope-francis-idol-money">the 
	new idolatry of money</a>&quot;.<p>As the Pope wrote in his &quot;<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html#No_to_an_economy_of_exclusion">apostolic 
	exhortation</a>&quot;: </p>
	<blockquote class="quoted">

		<p>The worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry 
		of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose. The worldwide 
		crisis affecting finance and the economy lays bare their imbalances and, above all, their lack 
		of real concern for human beings.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>His thoughts on income inequality are searing: </p>
	<blockquote class="quoted">

		<p>How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, 
		but it is news when the stock market loses two points? This is a case of exclusion. Can we continue 
		to stand by when food is thrown away while people are starving? This is a case of inequality.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The pope&#39;s screed on &quot;the economy of exclusion and inequality&quot; will disappoint those who considers 
	themselves free-market capitalists, but they would do well to listen to the message. Francis gives 
	form to the emotion and injustice of post-financial-crisis outrage in a way that has been rare since 
	Occupy Wall Street disbanded. There has been a growing chorus of financial insiders – from the<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/occupy-wall-st/wall-street-reflects-year-occupy"> 
	late Merrill Lynch executive Herb Allison</a> to organizations like
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/business/kelleher-leads-a-nonprofit-better-markets-in-fight-for-stricter-banking-rules.html">
	Better Markets</a> – it&#39;s time for a change in how we approach capitalism. It&#39;s not about discarding 
	capitalism, or hating money or profit; it&#39;s about pursuing profits ethically, and rejecting the 
	premise that exploitation is at the center of profit. When 53% of financial executives say they
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/wall-street-hard-time-ethical">can&#39;t get 
	ahead without some cheating</a>, even though they want to work for ethical organizations, there&#39;s 
	a real problem. </p>

	<p>Unlike Occupy, which turned its rage outward, Pope Francis bolstered his anger with two inward-facing 
	emotions familiar to any Catholic-school graduate: shame and guilt, to make the economy a matter 
	of personal responsibility.</p>

	<p>This is important. Income inequality is not someone else&#39;s problem. Nearly all of us are likely 
	to experience it. Inequality has been growing in the US since the 1970s. Economist Emmanuel Saez 
	found that the incomes of the top 1%
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/11/26/the-high-price-of-rising-income-inequality/">grew 
	by 31.4% in the three years after the financial crisis</a>, while the majority of people struggled 
	with a disappointing economy. The other 99% of the population grew their incomes 0.4% during the 
	same period. </p>

	<p>As a result, federal and state spending on social welfare programs has been forced to<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/united-states-senate-committee-on-the-budget/"> 
	grow to $1tn </a>just to handle the volume of US households in trouble. Yet income inequality has 
	been locked out of of the mainstream economic conversation, where it is seen largely as a sideshow 
	for progressive bleeding hearts.</p>

	<p>In the discussions of why the US is not recovering, economists often mention metrics like economic 
	growth and housing. They rarely mention the metrics that directly tell us we are failing our economic 
	goals, like
	<a title="More from the Guardian on Poverty" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty">poverty</a> 
	and starvation. Those metrics of income inequality tell an accurate story of the depth of our economic 
	malaise that new-home sales can&#39;t. One-fifth of Americans, or 47 million people, are on food stamps; 
	50% of children born to single mothers live in poverty; and over 13 million people are out of work. 
	Children are now <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_report_detail.aspx?id=85899363697">not 
	likely to do as well</a> as their parents did as downward mobility takes hold for the first time 
	in generations. </p>

	<p>The bottom line, which Pope Francis correctly identifies, is that inequality is the biggest economic 
	issue of our time – for everyone, not just the poor. Nearly any major economic metric – unemployment, 
	growth, consumer confidence – comes down to the fact that the vast majority of Americans are struggling 
	in some way. You don&#39;t have to begrudge the rich their fortunes or ask for redistribution. It&#39;s 
	just hard to justify ignoring the financial problems of 47 million people who don&#39;t have enough 
	to eat. Until they have enough money to fill their pantries, we won&#39;t have a widespread economic 
	recovery. You can&#39;t have a recovery if one-sixth of the world&#39;s economically leading country is 
	eating on $1.50 a day.</p>

	<p>It&#39;s only surprising that it took so long for anyone – in this case, Pope Francis – to become 
	the first globally prominent figure to figure this out and bring attention to income inequality.</p>

	<p>Income inequality is the issue that will govern whether we ever emerge from the struggling economy 
	recovery and it determine elections in 2014. The support for Elizabeth Warren to rise above her 
	seat in the US Senate, for instance, largely centers on
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115509/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clintons-nightmare">
	her crusade against inequality</a>. The White House&#39;s chirpy protestations that the economy is improving 
	are not fooling anyone.</p>

	<p>Into this morass of economic confusion steps Francis with clarifying force:</p>
	<blockquote class="quoted">

		<p>Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged 
		by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness 
		in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and 
		naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings 
		of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>It&#39;s a historic and bold statement, mainly because it&#39;s rarely heard from clergy. Money has always 
	been at odds with religion, going back to the times when God had a fighting chance against Mammon. 
	Moses grew enraged by the golden calf, Jesus by moneychangers in the temple, Muhammad by lending 
	money at interest, or usury. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for 
	a rich man to go to heaven, the Bible tells us.</p>

	<p>There have been criticisms from prominent men of religion before, but they didn&#39;t stick. in 2008, 
	the Archbishop of Canterbury endorsed Marx against the forces of &quot;<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3074907/Archbishops-of-Canterbury-and-York-blame-capitalism-excesses-for-financial-crisis.html">unbridled 
	capitalism</a>&quot;, and the Archbishop of York disdained traders as &quot;bank robbers and asset strippers&quot;, 
	but those cries went unheeded in the subsequent flood of corporate profits. </p>

	<p>At the time, those criticisms seemed extreme, throwing pitchforks into frozen ground. Francis 
	is speaking at a when the ground has been thawed. Outrage against the financial sector is lurking 
	so close to the surface that the US government can extract a
	<a  target="_blank" href="http://]http//www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/cost-of-financial-crisis-jpmorgan">
	$13bn fine</a> from the nation&#39;s largest bank, throwing it into its first financial loss in nine 
	years, and find significant approval. </p>

	<p>Still, popes have been largely content to leave these particular issues of economic inequality 
	behind in favor of focusing on social issues. There was, after all, a problem of throwing stones. 
	The church&#39;s rich trappings and vast wealth, as well as its scandal-plagued Vatican bank, made an 
	ill fit to preach too loudly about austerity.</p>

	<p>Pope Francis, in his<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.news.com.au/world/pope-francs-takes-ford-focus-over-presidential-guard-motorcade-despite-mafia-threat-fears/story-fndir2ev-1226760338343"> 
	simple black shoes and unassuming car</a> and house, is the first pontiff in a long time to reject 
	flashy shows of power and live by the principle of simplicity. That makes him uniquely qualified 
	to make the Vatican an outpost of Occupy Wall Street. His message about spiritual salvation applies 
	mainly to Catholics but it would be sensible for economists and lawmakers to recognize his core 
	message about the importance of income inequality applies to those even those who have no belief 
	in religion.</p>

	<p>Capitalism has always seen itself as an amoral pursuit, where the guiding stars were not &quot;good&quot; 
	or &quot;bad&quot;, but only &quot;profit&quot; and &quot;loss&quot;. It&#39;s going to be harder to sustain that belief over the 
	next few years. </p>

	<p><b>succulentpork</b> </p>
	<blockquote>

		<p><i>Capitalism has always seen itself as an amoral pursuit, where the guiding stars were not 
		&quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, but only &quot;profit&quot; and &quot;loss&quot;.</i></p>

		<p>This is simply not true. The advocates of capitalism have frequently in the past made the 
		case that it is a morally good system, or at least the best one that can be achieved. The argument 
		is that where it is applied to free markets capitalists can only make profit by giving to consumers 
		those things which they value most highly, and achieving this through cooperation under a system 
		of division of labour. The morality of this is that it does not use coercion to give people 
		benefits, it requires this cooperative process from people free to pursue their own interests. 
		Clearly the Pope never read Adam Smith who explained all this long ago. Many would see this 
		approach to individualism as deeply moral, especially compared to the alternative of religious 
		collectivism.</p>

		Look the Catholic Church won&#39;t make any significant impression on the world&#39;s economic and monetary 
		problems because it won&#39;t get down to determining exactly what mechanisms and balances are needed. 
		Instead it repeatedly turns to the Bible which not only was written a very long time ago and 
		therefore not dealing with our modern world but can basically be construed in large part as 
		simply cheer leading for human cooperation. Well and good but it&#39;s the detail (including the

		By its very definition trickle down won’t close the gap between rich and poor, what it permits 
		is the liberalisation of markets, which means that some agents will get very rich indeed but 
		the overall pie has got larger, enabling even those at the bottom to do materially better than 
		they would had we tightly controlled and allocated growth on the basis of fairness.<p>
		Now I think there is some truth in that proposition, but its far from conclusive. However the 
		Pope has effectively created a strawman and predictably the Guardian has leapt all over him 
		as the latest “saviour speaking out against capitalism” following on the illustrious heels of 
		Occupy, UK Uncut and Russell Brand…</p>

		<blockquote>

			<p>&quot;John Paul II taught that investment always has moral, as well as economic significance[96]. 
			All this — it should be stressed — is still valid today, despite the fact that the capital 
			market has been significantly liberalized, and modern technological thinking can suggest 
			that investment is merely a technical act, not a human and ethical one. There is no reason 
			to deny that a certain amount of capital can do good, if invested abroad rather than at 
			home. Yet the requirements of justice must be safeguarded, with due consideration for the 
			way in which the capital was generated and the harm to individuals that will result if it 
			is not used where it was produced[97]. What should be avoided is a speculative use of financial 
			resources that yields to the temptation of seeking only short-term profit, without regard 
			for the long-term sustainability of the enterprise, its benefit to the real economy and 
			attention to the advancement, in suitable and appropriate ways, of further economic initiatives 
			in countries in need of development. It is true that the export of investments and skills 
			can benefit the populations of the receiving country. Labour and technical knowledge are 
			a universal good. Yet it is not right to export these things merely for the sake of obtaining 
			advantageous conditions, or worse, for purposes of exploitation, without making a real contribution 
			to local society by helping to bring about a robust productive and social system, an essential 
			factor for stable development.&quot;</p>

		<p>This column is dead on. If we take out the retired and minors, the average income in the 
		U.S. should be about 70,000.00 dollars per year. The problem is not lack of funds but distribution 
		of funds. The idea that some earn immense incomes which they are not worth and have not earned 
		is the root of the problem. This will resolve itself during the next 2-3 decades... the easy 
		way or the hard way.<p>
		From a global perspective, the problem is much more difficult. The issue is that some societies 
		are simply more competent than others. I think intra national income redistribution is possible. 
		International is going to be much more difficult.<p>

What Pope Francis Gets Wrong About Capitalism</a><cite> By 
<a rel="author" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/author/rick-newman/">Rick Newman</a></cite></h4>
<blockquote>
	Yahoo<p>We get it: Pope Francis cares about the little guy. He speaks passionately about the rights 
	of the dispossessed, and more than that, shows solidarity with them through his own humble lifestyle 
	and rather unpapal rejection of pomp.</p>

	<p>The pope has gone a bit overboard, however, in his recent attack on free-market capitalism. In 
	a lengthy “<a data-mce-href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html#No_to_an_economy_of_exclusion" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html#No_to_an_economy_of_exclusion">apostolic 
	exhortation</a>,” Pope Francis rails against “an economy of exclusion” and a “ financial system 
	which rules rather than serves.” The pope points out that, in a time of miraculous technological 
	progress, alarming numbers of people still live in misery and desperation.</p>

	<p>“The culture of prosperity deadens us,” the pope writes. “We are thrilled if the market offers 
	us something new to purchase; and in the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity 
	seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.”</p>

	<p>The pope clearly follows the news, because income inequality and the growing wealth gap, which 
	he refers to several times, are hot topics nearly everywhere. But the pope has failed to notice 
	a few other important trends. First, he’s hardly the only one who’s concerned about the plight of 
	the have-nots. Income inequality has become a powerful political force in the United States and 
	many other countries, for the very reasons the pope cites. As those economic trends worsen, pressure 
	from below may very well cause political upheaval that at least somewhat reverses the rise of the 
	rich.</p>

	<p><strong>Generous fat cats</strong></p>

	<p>The pope’s generalizations bring to mind the cartoonish image of a fat cat in a pin-striped suit 
	smoking a cigar as he steps over a beggar in a gutter. But a lot of fat cats are quite sympathetic 
	toward the disenfranchised, and some are putting their money where their hearts are. Bill Gates 
	and Warren Buffett are the most obvious examples, with well over 100 barons of capitalism publicly 
	committed to their “<a target="_blank" href="http://givingpledge.org/" data-mce-href="http://givingpledge.org/">giving 
	pledge</a>,” agreeing to donate the majority of their considerable wealth to charitable causes.</p>

	<p>Charity only goes so far, of course. But there are also many efforts to rework the rules of capitalism 
	in the United States and other wealthy countries so the middle and lower classes have better economic 
	opportunities and a fighting chance to improve their living standards. This is very hard to do, 
	for a number of reasons. For one thing, it’s not easy to pinpoint the causes of growing income inequality, 
	which means fixing the problem is almost never as simple as just taking one person’s money and giving 
	it to something else. It’s also important to safeguard what’s good about capitalism — such as the 
	rewards for innovating and the ability to create wealth rather than just moving it around — while 
	fixing what doesn’t work. And of course those benefiting most from the current system have a vested 
	interest in keeping it that way — along with high-priced lobbyists on the payroll who are skilled 
	at doing so.</p>

	<p>Still, machinery is grinding forward in an effort to roll back the latest incarnation of capitalism&#39;s 
	excesses. In the United States, the 2009 Dodd-Frank reforms were an effort to rein in the financial 
	sector, much as the pope advocates. Progress is slow and some problems, such as powerful banks deemed 
	&quot;too big to fail,&quot; may escape solutions. But if you ask Wall Streeters, they feel as if they&#39;re 
	under siege, even if their paychecks remain inflated. It&#39;s a start, and it seems likely the U.S. 
	financial sector is going to face tougher scrutiny and tighter limits on greed for the foreseeable 
	future.</p>

	<p>Switzerland, meanwhile, recently voted on a referendum that would have severely limited CEO pay 
	and linked it to the wage levels of others in the same company. The measure failed at the ballot 
	box, but the mere fact that Switzerland -- a bankers&#39; haven -- would even consider such a scheme 
	shows that the least among us are gaining at least a little bit of leverage.</p>

	<p><strong>Marxism is over</strong></p>

	<p>Finally, for all of capitalism’s flaws, there’s basically no other system that offers the world’s 
	poor a better shot. The argument in favor of Marxist economies is basically over (despite the hysterical 
	cries of “socialism!” by some frightened American conservatives regarding the Obama administration). 
	A global century-long experiment with Marxism that ended around 1989 proved that it generates stagnation 
	and corruption and oppresses the human spirit in the bargain. Even China, which has a communist 
	government in both name and practice, has embraced capitalism as the economic system by which it 
	hopes to become a dominant world power. </p>

	<p>The pope doesn’t have much to say about what would be better than capitalism. He decries the 
	“new idolatry of money” (new? really?) while encouraging those with wealth and power to share both 
	with those who have less. Liberal idealists have been calling for that for centuries.</p>

	<p>What has been a lot more effective at raising the living standards of billions, however, is cold, 
	hard-edged capitalism and the riches dangled before those able to exploit it. Even now, in the raw 
	aftermath of a global financial crisis, capitalism is improving lives throughout China, India, Brazil, 
	many African nations and other long-suffering corners of the globe.</p>

	<p>Capitalism need not be unregulated, and in fact it rarely ever is. A true free-market is freer, 
	and crueler, than anybody really needs. With the right guidelines, capitalism is the best system 
	ever devised for improving lives and speeding human progress. It’s the guidelines we need to reevaluate, 
	not the free market itself.</p>

	Yahoo News</a></h6>

	<p>Pope Francis called for renewal of the Roman Catholic Church and attacked unfettered capitalism 
	as &quot;a new tyranny&quot;, urging global leaders to fight poverty and growing inequality in the first major 
	work he has authored alone as pontiff.</p>

	<p>The 84-page document, known as an apostolic exhortation, amounted to an official platform for 
	his papacy, building on views he has aired in sermons and remarks since he became the first non-European 
	pontiff in 1,300 years in March.</p>

	<p>In it, Francis went further than previous comments criticizing the global economic system, attacking 
	the &quot;idolatry of money&quot; and beseeching politicians to guarantee all citizens &quot;dignified work, education 
	and healthcare&quot;.</p>

	<p>He also called on rich people to share their wealth. &quot;Just as the commandment &#39;Thou shalt not 
	kill&#39; sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, <em>today we also have to 
	say &#39;thou shalt not&#39; to an economy of exclusion and inequality</em>. Such an economy kills,&quot; Francis 
	wrote in the document issued on Tuesday.</p>

	<p>&quot;How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but 
	it is news when the stock market loses 2 points?&quot;</p>

	<p>The pope said renewal of the Church could not be put off and said the Vatican and its entrenched 
	hierarchy &quot;also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion&quot;.</p>

	<p>&quot;I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, 
	rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,&quot; 
	he wrote.</p>

	<p>In July, Francis finished an encyclical begun by Pope Benedict but he made clear that it was 
	largely the work of his predecessor, who resigned in February.</p>

	<p>Called &quot;Evangelii Gaudium&quot; (The Joy of the Gospel), the exhortation is presented in Francis&#39; 
	simple and warm preaching style, distinct from the more academic writings of former popes, and stresses 
	the Church&#39;s central mission of preaching &quot;the beauty of the saving love of God made manifest in 
	Jesus Christ&quot;.</p>

	<p>In it, he reiterated earlier statements that the Church cannot ordain women or accept abortion. 
	The male-only priesthood, he said, &quot;is not a question open to discussion&quot; but women must have more 
	influence in Church leadership.</p>

	<p>POVERTY</p>

	<p>A meditation on how to revitalize a Church suffering from encroaching secularization in Western 
	countries, the exhortation echoed the missionary zeal more often heard from the evangelical Protestants 
	who have won over many disaffected Catholics in the pope&#39;s native Latin America.</p>

	<p>In it, economic inequality features as one of the issues Francis is most concerned about, and 
	the 76-year-old pontiff calls for an overhaul of the financial system and warns that unequal distribution 
	of wealth inevitably leads to violence.</p>

	<p>&quot;As long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy 
	of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution 
	will be found for the world&#39;s problems or, for that matter, to any problems,&quot; he wrote.</p>

	<p>Denying this was simple populism, he called for action &quot;beyond a simple welfare mentality&quot; and 
	added: &quot;I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of 
	society, the people, the lives of the poor.&quot;</p>

	<p>Since his election, Francis has set an example for austerity in the Church, living in a Vatican 
	guest house rather than the ornate Apostolic Palace, travelling in a Ford Focus, and last month 
	suspending a bishop who spent millions of euros on his luxurious residence.</p>

	<p>He chose to be called &quot;Francis&quot; after the medieval Italian saint of the same name famed for choosing 
	a life of poverty.</p>

	<p>Stressing cooperation among religions, Francis quoted the late Pope John Paul II&#39;s idea that 
	the papacy might be reshaped to promote closer ties with other Christian churches and noted lessons 
	Rome could learn from the Orthodox such as &quot;synodality&quot; or decentralized leadership.</p>

	<p>He praised cooperation with Jews and Muslims and urged Islamic countries to guarantee their Christian 
	minorities the same religious freedom as Muslims enjoy in the West.</p>
