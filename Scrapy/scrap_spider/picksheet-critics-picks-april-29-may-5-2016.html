"> American Cinematheque </a>, which calls them “the original Odd Couple,” is giving L&H fans new reasons to rejoice. Starting May 6 and using both the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Aero in Santa Monica, the Cinematheque is hosting three days of both 35 mm and digital screenings of restorations of a dozen shorts and two features, the celebrated “Way Out West” and the little-seen “The Flying Deuces.” Photochemically restored from from original nitrate elements, the shorts include a genuine classic, 1932’s Oscar-winning “The Music Box,” where the boys try their hardest to move a piano up a Silver Lake flight of stairs. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-bio-kenneth-turan-staff.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                            <p class="top-description">This spot-on mocking of a Bravo-style serve-the-rich workplace reality series comes to you from Seeso, NBCUniversal&#8217;s relatively new all-comedy subscription service. Here, Paul F. Tompkins plays a high-end Los Angeles real estate mogul who declares to his brokers that he has decided to make one of them a partner, precipitating aggressive competition among an already aggressively competitive staff. Created by Kulap Vilaysack (Nurse Kulap on &#8220;Childrens Hospital&#8221;), the show is semi-scripted — like reality television itself, one might say — which works or it doesn&#8217;t from moment to moment and line to line but lends the series an authentic air of uncertainty, of its characters not knowing exactly what they&#8217;re going to say. The performances run from the as-good-as-real to Tompkins&#8217; lordly, velvet-jacketed chairman, who seems to believe that he has invented real estate — &#8220;The idea of buying and selling bits of the earth, can you imagine the hubris? And yet, here we will stand.&#8221; Seeso, anytime.  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-tv-picks-bajillion-dollar-properties-prince-online-20160422-column.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                            <p class="top-description">Former &#8220;Onion&#8221; Editor Joe Randazzo wrote this hour-long sketch about the future Republican front-runner&#8217;s younger days. It stars a prosthetically altered, barely recognizable Johnny Depp as Donald Trump in what purports to be Trump&#8217;s own <span class="caps">TV</span>-movie adaptation of his memoir &#8220;The Art of the Deal,&#8221; supposedly preempted from its original scheduled airing by a football game and subsequently — in the words of Ron Howard, who introduces it — &#8220;thought to be lost in the Cybill Shepherd blouse fire of 1989.&#8221; (It later &#8220;turned up at a yard sale in Phoenix, Arizona,&#8221; says Howard. &#8220;I had to physically wrestle it from a nice woman named Jennie.&#8221;) Director Jeremy Konner, who also directs &#8220;Drunk History,&#8221; knows some things about re-creating a past world on a budget. It is not meant to be a perfect pastiche — the characters use words that could not be spoken on television then, they exhibit a knowledge of future events; Trump, who sometimes doesn&#8217;t understand references in a script he supposedly wrote himself, assesses his own performance, as himself, as Oscar worthy.  <a href="funnyordie.com"> Funny or Die.</a>  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-trump-parody-funny-or-die-20160211-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                                <p>Oh, Prince, Prince the unpronounceable, the artist, "The Artist," the Artist Formerly and Always Known as Prince, the Purple One, the man of many names and not-names, of many hairstyles and high heels, who wore his influences on his billowing sleeves yet made them all his own. He is gone, unbelievably, awfullly, and the world turns to the Internet to find — not much. Under the quite accurate claim that the Internet routinely deprives artists of income, encouraging a wider culture of digital shoplifting, Prince and his representatives kept and apparently will continue to keep a close watch on his intellectual property, with the result that the global video-sharing that constitutes how we grieve now has been short-circuited; besides having no officially available video of "When Doves Cry" or "Thieves in the Temple" to repost, you may also find that that low-res clip you linked to last night of Prince performing "Purple Rain" at First Avenue, has been blocked by the morning. But Prince was an internationally famous performer in an age of television, and he left traces in the ether; you can't erase them all. Here are some (as of this writing) surviving clips, not all of them musical, to get you through the sad days between denial and acceptance.

                                <h4>&#39;The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&#39; second season</h4>
                                <p>With the cancellation of "30 Rock," "Community" and "Parks and Recreation," NBC jettisoned a certain kind of jaunty, allusive, high-style, not necessarily highly rated satire that had kept it cool for at least one night a week — a change in direction confirmed when the network decided not to air this wonderful series, the next project from "30 Rock" creators Tina Fey and Robert Karlock. The show went to Netflix instead, where its second season — maybe even stronger than the first — has just become available. The story of a woman (Ellie Kemper) living in New York after 15 years of cultish imprisonment in an Indiana bunker — and therefore behind time historically, socially and emotionally but also full of hope and energy and has a resilient sense of self — it's a paean to difference and diversity; there is nothing on television anymore gloriously life-affirming. (In a less than subtle bit of externalization, the new season actually dresses Kimmy as an elf.)

                                <p>The second season of Mackenzie Crook's brilliant and beautiful pastoral comedy is now available on Acorn TV, almost your one-stop shopping center for British television, and it is just as well-wrought, funny, touching and lovely to behold as the first (which is now available via Netflix and Hulu). Crook, who was Gareth on the original British "The Office," Ragetti in "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Orell on "Game of Thrones," writes, directs and stars as Andy, a change-averse fellow who spends much of his free time, of which he has a lot, having no regular employment, with his friend Lance (Toby Jones), walking the fields and meadows with metal detectors in search of Saxon gold but pulling up mostly pull tabs and musket balls.

                                <p>Live from a relatively remote corner of the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., two 24-hour cams focus on the nest of the mated bald eagles known since 2014, when they first arrived, as Mr. President and the First Lady. One egg hatched Wednesday; a second is expected to hatch this weekend. It's as if, as national birds, they're trying to remind the body impolitic that there's more to this country than the weird noises emanating from the current presidential campaign, halls of Congress, etc., something that predates and hopefully will survive human fecklessness. (Still, it was people who put these cameras up; there may be hope for us yet.)

Parks cycles through genres with postmodern impunity, evoking classics not to make academic points but to set the stage for an epic journey — the journey of a black slave seeking his liberty as history slowly pivots. Directed with majestic fluidity by Jo Bonney, the production stars a deeply affecting Sterling K. Brown in the central role of Hero, whose master promises him his freedom if he joins him on the battlefield in the fight against the North.

                            <p class="top-description">Mass shootings, a staple of <span class="caps">CNN</span> programming, are so routine in America that it&#8217;s no wonder this violence has become part of the background fear of contemporary life. Julia Cho explores the insidious effect of this pervasive anxiety in her latest play, which stars Sandra Oh (“Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,” “Sideways”) in top form as an adjunct writing instructor who reaches out to a troubled Asian American student who has been deemed “a classic shooter” by another faculty member.

                                <p>Towne Street Theatre's multi-author answer to systemic racism throughout American history is a must-see.

                                <p>Not for the faint of heart, Ruby Rae Spiegel's play about the effects of an unwanted pregnancy on a tough but terrified teenage girl and her lonely new friend receives a taut and harrowing staging from director Alana Dietze and features precociously perfect performances by Teagan Rose and Connor Kelly-Eiding as high school swim teammates bonding in a time of confusion and crisis. Despite the occasional dramaturgical blunder, the sheer psychic clout of this visceral and important play should not be underestimated. You may flinch — but you will be unable to look away. (F.

                                <p>This buoyant, beautifully appointed take on George Bernard Shaw's early comedy is a textbook study in sprightly Shavian playing. Director Stephanie Shroyer understands that the secret to landing the ornate verbiage and ideological content is a light touch and absolute conviction of delivery. Her wonderful cast follows suit. The results, both elegant and tickling, are as definitive as we are likely to see any time soon. (David C.

                                <p>The 24th Street Theatre follows up last year's award-winning “Walking the Tightrope” with another play for families that touches on struggle and loss, “Man Covets Bird,” by the Australian playwright Finegan Kruckemeyer. If the storyline is a bit poetic and meandering, the performers are winsome and the production elements (including live music as well as charming, cartoony video projections) are beautifully designed. Both children 7 and up and adults will find something to enjoy in the experience.

                            <p class="top-description">In the music video for &#8220;Aviation,&#8221; the first song on their new album as the Last Shadow Puppets, Alex Turner and Miles Kane play two men forced to dig what look like their own graves by a suave but sadistic crime-boss type. There&#8217;s a woman too, weeping in the back seat of a vintage Rolls-Royce, and we seem meant to understand that she&#8217;s been caught carrying on with one of these guys; now her wicked husband is punishing the whole lot. Whatever the specifics, Turner and Kane — both Jason Statham-soulful in their grimy undershirts — are clearly identified as the noble victims in this little drama. Yet that&#8217;s rarely what they look like on &#8220;Everything You&#8217;ve Come to Expect,&#8221; the second full-length from this British orchestral-pop duo. Due Friday, the album comes nearly a decade after the Last Shadow Puppets&#8217; swooning 2008 debut, &#8220;The Age of the Understatement.&#8221; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-last-shadow-puppets-review-20160331-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                            <p class="top-description">Sixteen years ago, Gwen Stefani of No Doubt sang about wanting &#8220;a simple kind of life.&#8221; That&#8217;s not how things turned out. Sure, No Doubt — the Anaheim ska-pop band that blasted off in 1995 with the zillion-selling album &#8220;Tragic Kingdom&#8221; — continued its straightforward ascent for a few more years, racking up hit songs with impressive efficiency through the mid-2000s. But then Stefani launched a solo career that added new wrinkles to her sound and persona. She went into fashion and starting having children, which she&#8217;s said made a mess of her schedule. Following two huge solo records, she returned to No Doubt for a reunion album, 2012&#8217;s &#8220;Push and Shove,&#8221; which quickly fizzled, disrupting a narrative neatly defined to that point by success. Then last year, her life got really screwy: Stefani&#8217;s marriage to Gavin Rossdale, frontman of the band Bush, fell apart (reportedly because of his affair with the couple&#8217;s nanny), and she began dating Blake Shelton, the country star with whom she recently appeared on <span class="caps">NBC</span>&#8217;s &#8220;The Voice.&#8221; &#8220;Never thought this would happen &#8230; Don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m feeling,&#8221; she sings in &#8220;Used to Love You,&#8221; a moody, down-tempo single released only months after she filed for divorce. Stefani dives deeply into those complications on her first solo album in a decade. Due Friday, &#8220;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&#8221; has songs about betrayal and disappointment, and songs about moving on from a broken relationship and falling in love again.  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-gwen-stefani-review-20160317-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                                <p>You can't name your album "Anti" without inviting your audience to think about what you oppose. So what is Rihanna standing against on her eighth studio record? A smoothly choreographed product rollout, for one. After repeated delays, "Anti" finally appeared online Wednesday night, first in an apparently unauthorized leak, then as an exclusive on the streaming service Tidal; Samsung also gave away a limited number of free downloads through a complicated promotion. By Friday, the album was available for sale through iTunes (where it quickly topped the chart) and Tidal, though it hasn't yet shown up on other streaming services such as Spotify, and a physical release date has yet to be announced.

                                <p>There's something delightfully perverse that David Bowie waited until he was 69 to release what's being described as his first jazz album. It was at that age too when veteran rock stars who include Rod Stewart and Paul McCartney took up with big bands or reached for the Great American Songbook to demonstrate their taste and hard-won stature. Even Bob Dylan got in on the act last year with "Shadows in the Night," his lovely (if desolate) tribute to Frank Sinatra. So when you hear that Bowie hooked up with a New York saxophonist and his crew for “Blackstar,” out Friday (just two days before his death from cancer), you think perhaps that Bowie has joined the club — that after cycling through countless styles and personas over his half-century career, he’s finally become a finger-snapping crooner with Count Basie on his mind.  Ah, no. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-david-bowie-blackstar-review-20160108-story.html"> Read more </a>

                                <p>Is this becoming a habit? That's the question Prince raised Saturday morning when without warning he released a new album, "HitNRun Phase Two," on the streaming-music service Tidal. As its title suggests, the 12-track set follows an earlier album, "HitNRun Phase One," which Prince had made available in similar fashion in September — proof, it would seem, that this legendary control freak has shed his once-famous disdain for the unruly Internet. Maybe this double-shot system is how Prince, as prolific as he's ever been, intends to roll from here on out. Works for me. A proudly organic companion to the EDM-inflected "Phase One," Prince's latest album shows that he hasn't lost his interest in (or his knack for) the creeping funk and lush R&B balladry he was making in the early 1990s on records like the great "Diamonds and Pearls." <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-prince-hitnrun-phase-two-review-20151215-story.html"> Read more </a>

                                <h4>Album: &#39;25&#39;</h4>
                                <p>When Adele sings on her new album, "25," about an emotional experience so vivid that "It was just like a movie / It was just like a song," she's probably thinking of a tune by one of her idols: Roberta Flack, say, or Stevie Nicks. But for fans of this 27-year-old British singer, such a moment could only be captured by one thing: an Adele song. With her big hair and bigger voice, Adele broke out in 2008 as part of the British retro-soul craze that also included Duffy and Amy Winehouse. Her debut album, "19," spawned a hit single in "Chasing Pavements" and led to a Grammy Award for best new artist. Yet she outgrew any style or scene with the smash follow-up, "21," which presented Adele as a great crystallizer of complicated feelings, an artist writing intimately about her own life (in this case about a devastating breakup) in a way that somehow made the music feel universal. Clearly, the pressure is on to duplicate that commercial success with "25," which comes after a long period of public quiet in which Adele recovered from throat surgery and gave birth to a son (and tweeted no more than a few dozen times). "Hello," the record's brooding lead single, set a record when it was released last month, racking up 1.1 million downloads in a week. But the song's enthusiastic embrace only underscored the other, more pressing demand on the singer as she returns: that her music still provide its trademark catharsis. Put another way, Adele's fans have been waiting for years for new Adele songs to explain their experiences to them. And they get a worthy batch on "25." <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-adele-25-review-20151119-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <h4>Album: &#39;Bob Dylan — The Cutting Edge&#39;</h4>
                                <p>Among the many things Thomas Edison famously said, he remarked that "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration," and he also insisted that "I have not failed once. I have simply found 10,000 ways that do not work." Both precepts are clearly evident in "1965-1966: Bootleg Series Vol. 12," the revelatory latest release of Dylan archival recordings that comes out Nov. 6. Culling a mind- and ear-boggling wealth of outtakes, alternate versions and rehearsal snippets during sessions over the 14 months of an astonishingly fertile period for Dylan, which yielded three of the most influential albums in rock history — "Bringing It All Back Home," "Highway 61 Revisited" and "Blonde on Blonde" — the new set throws open a panoramic window into the creative process of one of the 20th century's greatest artists.

What you want to be eating is dizi, an Iranian lamb and chickpea stew, flavored with turmeric and dried lime — a popular street food dish from Tehran that seems to have a tonic effect against the chill. And for dizi, you should probably be at Nersses Vanak, a slightly faded restaurant in an industrial district of Glendale, where dizi, served with long-pickled garlic, platters of fresh herbs, and hot slabs of flatbread snatched smoking from the grill, is always the thing. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/food/jonathan-gold/la-fo-gold-nersses-20160116-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a>

                                <p>A decade or two from now, when line-caught sea bass will seem as rare and unobtainable as sturgeon caviar is now, drive-through windows sell more lentil bowls than cheeseburgers and we have gotten used to the idea of Taylor Swift as the governor of Pennsylvania, 2015 may well seem in retrospect a fairly important year in Los Angeles restaurants. Menus just seemed to be mostly vegetarian without anybody talking about it much, and even French chefs began to talk among themselves about the primacy of Mexican cooking. The differences between high and low cuisine, which had started to crumble as far back as the 1980s, were utterly annihilated. Exotic fermentation techniques began to creep out of the lab. The idea of abolishing the practice of tipping took hold. And as always, there were 10 dishes that attempted to encapsulate it all. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-10-best-dishes-gold-20151212-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <p>Is it possible to become converted in a single bite? Because with a single fried chicken wing at the original Portland Pok Pok in 2007, I dropped my prejudices about non-European cooking in Oregon, the crossover potential of extreme Asian funk, and the ability of a non-Thai to prepare anything like upcountry Thai food. So eight years, many affiliated restaurants, a James Beard award, a Michelin star and a Chinatown noodle stand later, here we are at Pok Pok Los Angeles, an enormous restaurant in the old Fu Ling space in the Mandarin Plaza at the relatively deserted north end of Chinatown. Chef Andy Ricker's gift is the ability to make Thai food seem new again, to take it out of that comfortable place in the suburban strip mall, where it has become the default takeout comfort food for a huge chunk of Los Angeles, and put it back into the roadside stands and rural villages of Northern Thailand. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/food/jonathan-gold/la-fo-1226-gold-20151226-story.html"> Read more </a>

                                <p>Abeles has been poking at the material residue of identity and extensions of the self for nearly 40 years, in tandem with her work relating to broader social and environmental concerns. This show thoughtfully surveys the more introspective strand of the Los Angeles artist's spirited practice.

                                <p>The artist's eight new paintings are not particularly attractive. Ugly colors, cluttered compositions and ham-fisted paint-handling make for works in which rudimentary images burble up from unsettled backgrounds awhirl with undigested restlessness. Anderson's oils on canvas are also intellectually sophisticated, physiologically complex and psychologically ambivalent (David Pagel) (Through May 14) <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-scott-anderson-review-ces-gallery-20160412-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <p>During the last 10 years an approach to art-making has been gathering force and gaining traction. It's called Deserted Island Abstraction, and its ethos is vividly displayed in one of the best two-person exhibitions to be staged recently. One glance at the wickedly wonderful stews of stuff each artist works with makes it clear that the two New Yorkers would paint and sculpt even if they were shipwrecked and had to scavenge for supplies on a deserted island.

                                <p>One of the most fascinating chapters in American art from the first half of the 20th century is also among the least known. An absorbing, must-see exhibition goes far in bringing the episode back into long-awaited view. Simply put: Issei photographers, most of whom immigrated to Los Angeles from Japan while still in their teens, went on to make some of the most adventurous avant-garde photographs in the years between the two World Wars.

As an imposing exhibition at the Getty Museum shows with splendid pomp and circumstance, big and elaborately woven tapestries were one useful tool.

For Alexievich — who in October became just the third nonfiction writer and 14th woman to receive the Nobel Prize in literature — testimony may be as close as one can get to faith. &#8220;We&#8217;ve worshipped many gods,&#8221; she writes in this slender but vivid account, told in the voices of survivors of the Soviet Afghan war. &#8220;Some have been consigned to the scrapheap, others to museums. Let us make Truth into a god! A god before whom each of us shall answer according to his own conscience, and not as a class, or a university year, or a collective, or a people&#8230;.&#8221;

                                <p>Stephen King, I've come to think, is at his most adept when writing in the midlength range. His big novels — "The Stand," "It," "11/22/63" — have always felt a little baggy to me, while his shortest work (he has published more than 200 stories, gathered in a number of collections) can feel sketchy, more idea than nuanced narrative. That middle zone, however: His finest efforts emerge from this territory, shorter novels "Misery," "Joyland" and "The Shining," novellas such as "The Body" or the chilling "A Good Marriage." In this material, King has the breadth to do what he does best, which is to evoke the very human underpinnings of terror, while also remaining constrained by certain limitations of space. As he explains in "The Bazaar of Bad Dreams," which gathers 20 pieces of fiction, along with brief reflections on their composition, "Only through fiction can we think about the unthinkable, and perhaps obtain some sort of closure." The key word there is not the unthinkable in which King traffics but "closure," the closure of the midrange form. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/reviews/la-ca-jc-stephen-king-20151108-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <h4>&#39;Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink&#39;</h4>
                                <p>New wave rocker, country crooner, balladeer, collaborator and showman: Elvis Costello has been all of these and more in the course of what is now a 40-year run. Of all the first-generation punkers, he remains (with Patti Smith and possibly David Byrne) among the few who can claim the longevity and diversity of, say, Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell, both of whom appear in this book. Like minds, perhaps, or water seeking its level. Either way, this is the company to which Costello belongs. And yet, if "Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink" has anything to tell us, it is that its author remains a fan. Here he is, for instance, on his first experience singing with Paul McCartney, a rehearsal duet on "All My Loving": "I locked on to the vocal harmony the second time around, as I'd done a thousand times before while singing along to the record. It never really occurred to me that learning to sing either vocal part on a Beatles record was any kind of musical education. I was just a kid singing along with the radio in our front room." Or this, recalling a good-natured cutting contest, trading lyrics with Bob Dylan: "It was just fun to be in the ring with the champ for a minute or two." <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-elvis-costello-20151018-story.html"> Read more </a>

                            <p class="top-description">Early in the film &#8220;Late Shift,&#8221; Matt, a student on his way to a night job, faces an easily relatable dilemma: help a lost tourist with directions and risk being late to work or ignore the man and hop on a waiting subway train. Here is where you would expect director Tobias Weber to show the audience the outcome of Matt&#8217;s decision as the story unfolds. Matt&#8217;s choice, however, is up to you, the viewer. In fact, you control every major plot turn in the film. &#8220;Late Shift,&#8221; created by CtrlMovie, a small studio in Switzerland, and written by Weber and Michael Robert Johnson, best known for Guy Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; may be the world&#8217;s first fully realized choose-your-own-adventure film. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-hc-the-player-late-shift-20160501-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                            <p class="top-description">The opening of Universal Studios&#8217; new Wizarding World of Harry Potter Hollywood brings to the West Coast what many consider the grandest theme park attraction in North America. A mix of fully realized sets — including a steamy, fire-breathing dragon — as well as screens interspersed with actors from the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; films, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a highly kinetic motion simulator that aims to re-create the sense of flying. Guests sit on what appears to be a bench, pull down an over-the-shoulder harness and are soon whisked into the air, gliding in and out of filmed moments and elaborately constructed scenes. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-hc-the-player-harry-potter-20160410-story.html"> Read&nbsp;more </a></p>

                                <h4>A Few New Mobile Video Games</h4>
                                <p>There are a lot of mobile games out there — last year more than 100,000 iOS games were released in North America. Here are a few recent mobile games worthy of exploration:

<strong>"Love You to Bits"</strong> (Alike/Pati). Breakups stink. They're worse when your girlfriend is scattered around the galaxy. In this iOS game a young boy tries to put back together his first love, a female robot, and learns to live on his own along the way.

<strong>"Story Warriors: Fairy Tales"</strong> (Below the Game). Tales such as "Snow White," "Little Red Riding Hood," "Cinderella" and more get remixed in this text-driven puzzler about a young woman who gets trapped in folklore. Tap on words to bring them to life, and piece together nouns and adjectives as if they're math problems, the right solution inspiring a cutesy animated sequence.

<strong>"SPL-T"</strong> (Simogo). Swedish studio Simogo is one of the most adventurous companies out there, specializing in head-scratching, text-heavy games such as "Device 6" and "The Sailor's Dream." "SPL-T" is a back-to-basics puzzle game. In the black and white game, players place a horizontal line and then a vertical one, trying to create as many splits as possible.

<strong>"Super Phantom Cat" </strong>(Veewo). Cats! Robots! "Super Phantom Cat" takes the weirdness of "Super Mario Bros.," gives it a zany feline-meets-sci-fi makeover, and uses slick touch controls to create a freshly retro experience. It's all delivered with a gooey feel-good message and some rainbow-hued prettiness.

<strong>"The Swords." </strong>(Sunhead Games). Imagine a scene in an action movie, one in which one swordsman is surrounded by an army on all sides. Now imagine all the action is presented in a minimal ink wash art style. By zeroing in on the blades, "The Swords" emphasizes the chaos of battle. Swipe fast, and do so with precision.

                                <p>Dave Hagewood didn't set out to create the next big thing in electronic sports. Ten years ago he simply envisioned a game in which cars did crazy things. Cars with rockets on them. The result was the breakout independent game of 2015, "Rocket League." The key to its success was one simple addition to Hagewood's original vision: a giant, bouncy soccer ball. Thus, a zany game in which cars crashed into one another became something else entirely, a madcap sport. "Rocket League" has now reached more than 12 million players, with revenue topping $70 million. In late February, the game — already a hit on Sony's PlayStation 4 and computing platform Steam — arrived on Microsoft's Xbox One, where in less than a month it attracted more than 1 million players. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-hc-theplayer-rocket-league-20160313-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <h4>&#39;Fire Emblem Fates&#39;</h4>
                                <p>In my first 25 hours with Nintendo 3DS' "Fire Emblem Fates," families argued, attempts at flirting were rebuffed and relatives threw a fit over poorly cooked meals. Were it not for the swords and the spells and the half-fox/half-human, the game wouldn't be all that different from the last month or so of my life. Though there is sword and sorcery here, including a main character who has the ability to turn into a dragon, "Fire Emblem Fates" is really about family drama. In this case, it's about the pull of one's blood family versus the connection with an adopted one. Do you help the stepbrothers and stepsisters who always supported you, or the brothers and sisters you've only just met? The player's avatar, which can be male or female, was kidnapped at a young age and raised as a warrior prince/princess. Her (I chose a female avatar and named her Kes) adopted-but-criminal family took good care of her, and it's clear she's tight with her siblings. But her father — a.k.a. the king — is a monster. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-theplayer-fireemblem-20160220-story.html"> Read more </a>

                                <p>"Firewatch," set in the quiet Wyoming wilderness, is a game in which its main character does little more than walk. Yet at its heart this is a game about running. It's about running from our pasts, running from our emotional trials and running from the unknown. It's about how avoidance often makes things worse and how the road to conquering our fears can be downright frightening. And things get pretty bad in "Firewatch." <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-hc-the-player-firewatch-20160214-story.html"> Read more </a>

And while the game is pure goofiness when it starts — simply mash a couple of buttons to run the red carpet and dodge photographers — it goes dark, and quickly. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-video-game-pokes-fun-at-lack-of-diversity-at-the-oscars-20160216-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <p>Draw a line. It sounds simple, doesn't it? "The Witness," from a sort of zoned-out satellite view, is a game about drawing lines. To be even more precise, it is a game populated with puzzles, the bulk of them solved by drawing a line. Again, it all sounds so simple. Yet "The Witness" just so happens to be the rare puzzle game that's less about answers and more about mysteries and epiphanies. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-the-player-the-witness-20160131-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <p>Meet Yarny. Yarny doesn't look like much at a quick glance. Yarny is red, the size of an index finger with an alien, triangular face and nimble body made up of a single piece of, well, yarn. Yarny is quite fragile. Keep Yarny out of water, and don't let Yarny near a critter. A single claw of a crab will wreak havoc on Yarny. Yarny is also full of personality, the standout star of a new video game dubbed "Unravel." Those old family photographs collecting dust on a bookshelf? Yarny wants to explore them, transport inside them and make old connections feel new again. Among Yarny's likes is nostalgia. Dislikes? Families that drift apart. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-the-player-unravel-20160207-story.html"> Read more </a></p>

                                <p>With famed film mogul Sam Goldwyn as her grandfather, Liz Goldwyn's family name is practically synonymous with old-school Hollywood glamour. But it's Los Angeles before it became the capital of the motion picture industry that's the subject of the style maven's new book, "Sporting Guide: Los Angeles, 1897" (Regan Arts). The work of historical fiction looks back on the city's seedier past, with loosely connected stories about the madams, prostitutes, orphans, hustlers and tramps who roamed Alameda, Los Angeles and Spring streets. I chatted with Goldwyn about what drew her to this time period in L.A., her impressions of the book's rough characters, and what role women had in a culture where prostitution was tolerated. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-liz-goldwyn-20151115-story.html"> Read more </a>
