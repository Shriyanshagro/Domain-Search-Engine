<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  3 May 2010</p>
<p>This started as a post to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1307649">hacker
news</a>, which has now been
expanded to cover some history and give some background to the Fastmail
company and the sale to Opera. I'm one of the main developers and was
one of the (now previous) owners of Fastmail. This post is partly for
historical interest, and also to give the Fastmail community some
insight into the future of the service.</p>

<h3>Starting Fastmail</h3>

<p>Fastmail started around 1999 when Jeremy Howard prototyped the first
version and brought me on board to help develop the website. While both
of us were reasonably experienced programmers, neither of us had done
any web development. When we looked at the way to develop websites - CGI
scripts in those days - we didn’t really like the way they worked, so I
ended up developing a web framework to help make the application
development easier. We still use that framework today. While it’s a bit
esoteric, it has served us well and includes <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/2010/02/25/fastmail-and-sessions/">some features that are
fairly
unique</a>, even
to this day.</p>

<p>Jeremy had come from a management consulting background, and so had
spent a lot of time onsite with customers. While email was a very
important part of getting work done, he found the options available very
limited. In those days, people could either get basic POP email from
their ISP, or free but slow and ad-laden webmail sites (eg.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotmail">Hotmail</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocketMail">RocketMail</a>) that had less
features (no POP, SMTP and certainly no IMAP). So we decided to
concentrate on being a premium email provider that targeted users that
wanted a professional service with lots of features (multiple
personalities and signatures, aliases, plus addressing, sub-domain
addressing, filing and filtering emails, etc), a fast interface (no ads,
no graphics), open access to their email (POP and IMAP support) and
solid customer support - and were willing to pay for it.</p>

<h3>Building and growing the service</h3>

<p>The original implementation started on one server at rackspace.com, and
we started to let friends use it. We then started to publicise it more
widely, mostly via word of mouth and on the forum Edwin helped us set up
at <a href="http://www.emailaddresses.com">www.emailaddresses.com</a> (now
<a href="http://www.emaildiscussions.com">www.emaildiscussions.com</a>). We offered
the service as free while building out the application, but from day one
we told users that it would be targeted as a paid service.</p>

<p>With only myself and Jeremy as developers, customer support, system
administration and forum support, it took us a while to get to the stage
where we were happy with the service and ready to bill users, which
started in 2002.</p>

<p>One of the things that the founders tried to avoid was taking on
external debt, and Jeremy used his savings to fund the initial
development. Initially I was just employed as a programmer, but with the
successful launch and growth of the service and the work that required,
it was decided to form a company, and bring myself and another person
(Bruce Davey) in as the owners. Later on, another person would also buy
in to the business, creating an equal partnership of four people.</p>

<p>Over the next decade or so, Fastmail continued on a fairly simple path.
We kept building up the service, adding features and trying to scale to
more users. We tried a few times to bring on more programmers, though we
had mixed success with that until we finally built a small and core
group that has been stable for the last 5 years or so.</p>

<p>As a side note, a few years back a friend lent me a book called <a href="http://www.chriswest.info/my-books/the-beermat-entrepreneur">The
Beermat
Entrepreneur</a>.
If you’re thinking of starting a small business, especially IT related,
I think this book is a great read. It may have first been written almost
two decades ago (an eternity in Internet time), but even with my single
data point, the advice in it really resonated, especially the parts
about people.</p>

<p>It talks about the 5 core people, the entrepreneur and the 4 cornerstone
people you need to cover technical skills, delivery (operational side of
the business), sales and finance. I can really see how each of those
roles is important to a business. Jeremy was definitely the driving
entrepreneurial force, always pushing the big idea. Bruce was our
financial controller who made sure that we sold things for more than it
cost to run them (important if you want a business to survive!) and I
was the technical lead.</p>

<p>I think initially we lacked the delivery cornerstone, and were lucky to
find Bron who brought a structure and repeatability to our setup that
allowed us to recover from our small disaster in 2006 (2-3 day outage
for a big chunk of users) to build the incredibly reliable and solid
infrastructure we now have to deliver our service. The one thing we
should have done from the start was to have someone in charge of sales.
After the initial success from word of mouth, I think we expected sales
to keep accelerating. In hindsight, it’s clearly the thing that we never
executed well.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to do sales our self, we tried to get other people to
do it for us. We did that by creating a co-branding system that allowed
people to resell the Fastmail email service under a completely different
brand with a customisable look and feel. Unfortunately that was a
failure. Setting up a new co-brander took too much work, and every
co-brander we tried was worse at sales and marketing than we were. They
often expected to be able to just set the brand up, and gain users with
little or no effort.</p>

<h3>Recent status and changes in the email market</h3>

<p>Fastmail has always been a small company. Today there are still just 3-4
main developers (myself, Bron, Richard and just in the last year,
Kurian), and a couple of support staff (Yassar, Vinodh &amp; Larry)
scattered around the world. Despite (or possibly because of) those
limited resources, I think we've managed to build a great product with
lots of niche and powerful features as well as loyal users. We've also
been <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/help/overview_reliability.html">incredibly
reliable</a>,
especially in <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/reports/lzdx4pr0pdhk/">recent
years</a>, as we worked hard
to make sure that we learned all we could from the shortcomings that led
to the outage event in 2006.</p>

<p>Fastmail has been nicely profitable for many years, but not
spectacularly so. As the above paragraphs show, we're mostly technical
and support people, and we don't have a marketing or sales department
that can grow our customer base significantly. We did try recently, and
I have to thank Jack Miller for the hard work he put in in that area,
but unfortunately it didn't work out. Realistically only business
accounts can have a reasonable return on any sales investment, and we
really should have developed our business product 3-4 years earlier than
we did. We were slow to enter that market and behind the leaders.</p>

<p>Again I think this relates back to the lack of a sales cornerstone
again. Rather than having someone testing to market to see what
profitable areas we should be attacking, we probably preferred to spend
our time building neat technical stuff, fixing that edge case bug, or
doing that fun thing... we’re really just geeks that like working with
technology.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I think we had to face facts a bit; we were a small fish
with limited resources in a market that has become vastly more
competitive in recent years. We also needed to invest a large chunk of
time and money in updating our interface and adding new features,
especially better mobile synching, if we were to take that next leap.</p>

<h3>Approach by Opera</h3>

<p>Coincidentally, it's around the time that we were considering our
options that Opera came along and started a conversation with us.
Despite being half a world apart, there turned out to be a lot of fit
between our companies. They use a lot of <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>,
as do we. They're a company <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/executive/">run by technology
people</a>, creating a product
that's loved by geeks, is highly customisable, has a loyal fan base, and
despite its small size, punches above its weight. I think that summary
pretty much describes Fastmail as well.</p>

<p>So the timing was right, and Opera have an interest in picking up email
as a core competency as well as a number of ideas about what they want
to improve and what they want to build. As the other Fastmail staff are
also interested in new opportunities, we are all making the transfer and
becoming Opera staff and are committed to working there for several
years at the very least. There's already plans for some staff to move to
Norway to work, a change of life after 5 years of just the 3 of us in a
single office (apparently the Norwegian lessons are paying off... Jeg
vil gjerne et øl til).</p>

<h3>Looking forward to the future</h3>

<p>It will be an interesting change, and something new which I’m looking
forward to. I've been working for Fastmail for 10 years now. It's been a
great time. I've loved building the product and the company. Like
anything, there's been ups (it's fun developing a site that customers
really love and tell you about) and downs (some people are addicted to
being able to access their email at all times, and running a 24/7 email
service means that if people can't get to their email for even just 1
minute, you'll start hearing about it). After 10 years, it'll be strange
having a boss again. I've met a bunch of the Opera people, and it'll be
really great working with them. I know the other staff are also looking
forward to working with the Opera team.</p>

<p>It will also be great to be able to work with Neil Jenkins again, who is
also going to work for Opera having nearly finished his university
studies. He worked for us over a couple of summers, and basically
designed the entire "new" web interface, all the HTML, CSS and JS. We've
already got 80% of a whole new AJAX interface done (remember in
programming though, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule">the first 90% takes 90% of the time, the remaining
10% takes the other 90% of the
time</a>), and I'm looking
forward to completely finishing that work.</p>

<p>Of course there’s lots of other work that we’ll be doing with Opera,
some of which I can’t comment on at this stage, but some of which we’re
already working on.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Bron has probably become the worlds expert on
<a href="http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/">cyrus</a>, the IMAP server we use. Recently
he’s been refactoring
<a href="http://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/pipermail/cyrus-devel/2010-March/001406.html">large</a>
<a href="http://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/pipermail/cyrus-devel/2010-March/001409.html">sections</a>
of the
<a href="http://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/pipermail/cyrus-devel/2010-April/001419.html">code</a>
to make it even more stable and RFC compliant, and adding new code to
reduce the amount of IO required (eg. make it faster), and radically
reduce the amount of bandwidth required for replication, which will be
very useful in a multi-data-center setup.</p>

<p>Richard has been working on making sure every part of Fastmail is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> compliant, which will
allow us in the future to translate the interface to different
languages, and will finally mean that non-english folder names can be
displayed correctly in the web interface.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.fastmail.fm/2010/04/30/fastmail-fm-has-been-acquired-by-opera-software/">original blog post about the
sale</a>,
FastMail.FM will continue to run and grow as the reliable email service
you’ve known for over 10 years. Opera have clear plans for the future,
and can help provide significantly more resources to build a bigger and
better infrastructure and provide even more features.</p>
