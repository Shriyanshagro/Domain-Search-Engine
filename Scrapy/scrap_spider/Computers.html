<p>There are very few decent Unix security books. The reason is easy to explain: 
security is a dumping ground for professionals and few if any of those authors have 
in depth understanding of the system they are writing about comparable with the 
level of understanding of the author of an advanced book on the subject. There are 
a lot of snake oil salesmen in security that try to propagate FUD about hackers 
and comprovises. </p>

<p>So the task of finding one is pretty difficult and it might be that one can probably 
be better off&nbsp; buying a decent <a href="unix.shtml">Unix system administration 
book </a>and <a href="unixsec.shtml">TCP/IP networking </a>book with security chapters, 
than a book specialized in security and written by a clueless author. After all 
a good defense is always based on real knowledge and in the case of Unix/Internet 
security on the knowledge of Internet protocols and Unix internals (or at least 
Unix system administration). Junk books like Harking Exposed are making money by 
pring to provide a popular (and extremely superficial) view on a very complex topic. 
IMHO a good Unix security book presuppose deep knowledge of OS and networking.
</p>

<p>In case of security books it&#39;s probably unreasonable to expect them to cover 
recent trends. They should concentrate on fundamental principles of security. Essentially 
the best source of&nbsp; the most recent information on Unix and Internet&nbsp; 
security is Internet itself. The field is too dynamic and it&#39;s difficult to write 
books that cover recent trends. With typical year or more writing/editing/publishing 
cycle they will be outdated before they will be finished. But for the fundamental, 
core issues and introductory material books are a better deal that Internet materials 
and can help you save time and effort in mastering this large and difficult field. 
Unix security consists of two interconnected parts:</p>

<ul>

	<li>OS-related stuff (some of it is version specific, so Linux books are not 
	that helpful for Solaris administrators and vise versa).</li>

	<li>Networking and TCP/IP related stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>Some books concentrate on tools, some on principles. The main principle of security 
is famous KISS principle, and that can serve as a litmus test during book evaluation. 
If they do not stress the importance of stripping the system down to minimum number 
of components it&#39;s quite possible that other areas are covered weakly as well.</p>

<p>For security books one should be especially beware about &quot;lemming effect&quot; reviews, 
when a lot of newcomers to the field praise a very weak book with an attractive 
title. The word &quot;Hacking&quot; is a real cash cow in the security book title.&nbsp; I 
recommend you to be <b><i>very</i></b> skeptical about&nbsp; any security book with 
this particular word in the title; real professionals are seldom so greedy, snake 
oil salesmen usually are&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>Among semi-decent Unix security books I would like to mention&nbsp; <b>
<a href="#Scott_Mann">Linux System Security: The Administrator&#39;s Guide to Open Source 
Security Tools</a></b>&nbsp; by Scott Mann. Contrary to the title it&#39;s not a Linux 
specific book: it covers generic free Unix tools. Although tools themselves are 
covered rather superficially, this book can help understanding your tools needs 
and might be instrumental in installing and using of some of recommended tools.
</p>

<p>A rare good book is <b><a href="#Brenton1999">Mastering Network Security</a>
</b>by Chris Brenton.</p>

<p>So far a decent (but outdated) introductory book on Unix security is still
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1565921488/ref=nikolaibezroukov">
Practical Unix and Internet Security</a>. I am not big fun of this book, but still 
I would like to admit that it&#39;s a decent book. The major drawback is that it&#39;s not 
tools oriented and large part of it is quite outdated. See
<a href="../Reviews/PUIS.html">my review of the book</a>. But the biggest advantage 
of this book is that it&#39;s available in HTML. I feel that it should be used with

Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security</a></p>

<blockquote>

	<p>by Paco Hope, Yanek Korff, Bruce Potter</p>

	<p>If you are looking at implementing one of the BSD distributions of Linux 
	and want to secure your installation this book is an excellent choice. The authors 
	cover the basic security that applies to all Linux distributions such as filesystem 
	security and creating a sandbox, and then follows up with security options specific 
	to BSD. The chapters cover installation, secure administration, creating a secure 
	DNS server, secure mail servers (including Sendmail, Postfix, and qmail), secure 
	web server, firewalls, intrusion detection, system auditing and incident response, 
	and some forensics. However, the forensics information provides a decent overview 
	without being detailed enough to be very useful. <p>
	The authors do a really good job of explaining not only how to do various tasks 
	but also the reasoning behind it and how it works to resolve specific problems. 
	I like the fact that the authors don&#39;t do this in a piecemeal approach but provide 
	a pathway to get to the system hardened before heading off into the specifics 
	of harding particular services link DNS and Sendmail. They actually have a step 
	by step procedure starting from a fresh install. This alone makes this one of 
	the better books on hardening FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD 
	Security is highly recommended.</p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hardening part (Ch 02) is weak. The author does 
	not understand the compromises involved. The only useful chapter is Ch04. Common 
	break-ins by subsystem. But it&#39;s not in depth (DNS part is extremely weak). 
	But used book can be bought for $5 or less and at this price might make sense.

	<p>Target Audience<br>
	Network administrators or security administrators who want to assess the security 
	of their systems. </p>

	<p>Contents<br>
	This book is a series of assessments that you can do to your systems to determine 
	the level of your system security </p>

	<p>The book is divided into the following chapters: Network Security Assessment; 
	The Tools Required; Internet Host And Network Enumeration; IP Network Scanning; 
	Assessing Remote Information Systems; Assessing Web Services; Assessing Remote 
	Maintenance Services; Assessing FTP And Database Services; Assessing Windows 
	Networking Services; Assessing Email Services; Assessing IP VPN Services; Assessing 
	Unix RPC Services; Application-Level Risks; Example Assessment Methodology; 
	TCP, UDP Ports, And ICMP Message Types; Sources Of Vulnerability Information
	</p>

	<p>Review<br>
	Every day brings word of new exploits and new security bugs in various operating 
	systems. Some are new and unique, and many are rehashed exploits made possible 
	by the failure to patch and secure your systems. In order to see your system 
	as a cracker would, you need to understand the mindset and toolsets that are 
	used against you. This book, Network Security Assessment, will help you do just 
	that. </p>

	<p>Each chapter starts with a brief explanation of the area being discussed, 
	as well as some of the overall security concerns related to that service. The 
	rest of the chapter is then devoted to various exploits and tools that can be 
	launched against the different operating systems. Chris McNab uses extensive 
	illustrations and output listings to show the reader how the tools work and 
	what type of information can be exposed to an attacker. Since many of the tools 
	are Unix-based or are expected to be used against Unix-type systems, the author 
	does assume familiarity with administration of Unix variants. </p>

	<p>There are a lot of things to like about this book. The assessment methodology 
	is organized and well thought out. It&#39;s not just a random scattering of exploits. 
	The author also takes great pains to provide the sites where you can download 
	the tools. In addition to that, the tools are also mirrored at the O&#39;Reilly 
	site so that you are protected against websites that may move around. The argument 
	could be made that this provides a fledging cracker with all the information 
	they need to break into your system. True, but the information already exists, 
	and they will find it with or without this book. This book levels the playing 
	field by making security information available to corporate administrators so 
	that they have a chance against attackers. </p>

	<p>Conclusion<br>
	A worthy addition to the bookshelf of network and security administrators. By 
	following the exploits and processes outlined, you&#39;ll be able to sleep well 
	knowing that you&#39;ve covered as many bases as you can. </p>

	<b>Man Page Reprint</b>, February 19, 2003</p>

	<p>Reviewer: <b>A reader </b>from Atlanta, GA United States </p>

	<p></font>If you don&#39;t read the man pages then this book is for you. After reading 
	the glowing reviews I went out to purchase this book. I am extremely disappointed. 
	The lion-share of the book is merely API description. There are some neat examples 
	in every chapter, but they are available on the internet... The end chapters 
	of the book are well written concise summaries of known techniques and concepts 
	(possibly the only redeeming component of the book)<br>
	<i><b>After using libnet I was expecting something great from the man who wrote 
	such an awesome library.</b></i> Experienced programmers should use the man 
	pages. If you&#39;re new to information security topics then you might find this 
	book useful.<br>
	A newbie would be well served by this book. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">this is pretty much the book I&#39;ve been looking to add to my 
	library for a while. schiffman covers the major libraries in security (libnet, 
	libdnet, libpcap, openssl, libsf, and libnids) in a smooth and excellent way, 
	and then brings them together in several small apps and then firewalk 5.0. in 
	this book we learn techniques to complement the tools we learn how to craft.
	</font></p>

	<p><font size="2">i was a bit let down in some of the details being left out 
	of the libraries schiffman didn&#39;t write, such as pcap and ssl. these are really 
	difficult to master libraries, some more attention could have been given here.
	</font></p>

	<p><font size="2">another reviewer noted that the book really ignores the windows 
	developer, which is true to an extent. however, what schiffman doesn&#39;t say (and 
	the reviewer doesn&#39;t state) is that several of the libraries (pcap, libnet, 
	libdnet, openssl) work just fine on windows. it would have been helpful to have 
	seen that covered more, but perhaps in the next edition. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">all in all, a recommended book. now infosec people will have 
	no reason to say they can&#39;t write their own network attack apps. and hopefully 
	it will inspire someone to write a better mousetrap, too. i&#39;m still surprised 
	it took so long to appear on the shelves! <br>

	<p><font size="2">There are many security books on the shelves today. Most of 
	them describe the same hacker tools and methods. They don&#39;t get very technical 
	and once you&#39;ve read one, you&#39;ve read them all. Building Open Source Network 
	Security Tools is a different breed of security book. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">Building Open Source Network Security Tools , just as the 
	name suggests, is about how to build network security tools. This is a technical 
	book, so you are going to have a little knowledge of C and your networking principles. 
	This is definitely not a managers book. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">First the book describes some basic principles in developing 
	security software. This is a quick primer in case you have never been involved 
	in software development. Next the book goes on to describe several commonly 
	used libraries like libnet and libpcap. For each library, the structures and 
	functions are explained, then there is sample code. I have written programs 
	using libpcap and libnet before and I still learned something. There is even 
	a section on OpenSSL programming. OpenSSL is a rather large and cryptic, no 
	pun intended, library (in my experience anyways). This book sheds some light 
	on it! These chapters are a great reference to have when making a new security 
	tool. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">The author then goes on to explain the several techniques 
	like attack and penetration and active reconnaissance. Not only does the author 
	tell you how they would in a technical sense, he provides code that does it, 
	and explains each piece. This is very useful since most tools in the wild aren&#39;t 
	very well commented ;) There is also a chapter on buffer overflows and format 
	string vulnerabilities. These chapters are very well done and do a good job 
	in explaining how they work and how to write code to use them. It may sound 
	like this is an offensive hacker book, but it also gives examples on how to 
	write defensive programs, like a port scan detection tool. At the end of the 
	book the author ties it all together with a large program that utilizes many 
	of the techniques mention in the book. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2">I found this book to be very refreshing. I had been waiting 
	for a good security programming reference, and this is it. As a part of the 
	Honeynet Project, I have seen a large number of compromises and tools, and one 
	thing I&#39;ve found is that in order to truly know who your enemy is, and how they 
	operate, you need to know how their tools work. I wish this book had been released 
	years ago when I first became interested in network security. It would have 
	saved me from stumbling around old web pages and dead links. If you&#39;re an information 
	security professional, this book is a must have for your library.</font>

			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I am a senior engineer for network security 
			operations. I am not a Solaris system administrator, but I read &quot;Hack 
			Proofing Sun Solaris 8&quot; (HPSS8) to learn more about securing Solaris 
			systems. HPSS8 addresses a wide variety of Solaris security issues, 
			and is suitable for beginning and intermediate system administrators.<p>
			HPSS8 is not a Solaris version of &quot;Hack Proofing Linux&quot; (HPL), which 
			I reviewed in October. While HPL seems more like a catalog of open source 
			security tools, HPSS8 focuses on explaining the features and configuration 
			of Solaris hosts. The authors provide useful explanations of Trusted 
			Solaris, with enhancements like Role Based Access Control and Mandatory 
			Access Control. Admins unwilling to deploy Trusted Solaris can experiment 
			with the SunSCREEN Basic Security Module (BSM), which raises a default 
			Solaris 8 installation to the C2 security level. HPSS8 describes how 
			to deploy Sun&#39;s Kerberos implementation, called Sun Enterprise Authentication 
			Mechanism (SEAM). The book also introduced me to Sun&#39;s implementation 
			of file-based access control lists to protect SUID files.<p>
			As a casual reader, not responsible for implementing these tools, I 
			found HPSS8&#39;s coverage adequate. I learned about enterprise-grade security 
			features I never knew existed. I&#39;m not sure if admins needing in-depth 
			explanations will find what they need in HPSS8. <p>
			HPSS8 appears to be written by authors who know their material. I found 
			no errors, although I admit I am not a Solaris expert. The network security 
			discussions, with which I am more familiar, seemed error-free as well. 
			I appreciated the heavily technical buffer overflow explanation in ch. 
			10, and was surprised to learn in ch. 8 that Solaris by default routes 
			packets between multiple interfaces. The only slip in editing appeared 
			to be unnecessary &quot;double coverage&quot; of Snort (in ch. 3 and ch. 8), probably 
			written by different authors.<p>
			If you&#39;re a junior Solaris admin and you need to lock down your machines, 
			securely operate web, email, caching, routing, firewalling, and related 
			services, HPSS8 will definitely help you. Senior Solaris admins will 
			probably not learn new tricks. Security professionals who want to familiarize 
			themselves with Solaris features will enjoy reading HPSS8, as I did.<p>

	This is the first book I have bought from the Craig Hunt Linux library and judging 
	by this volume I will be buying more. </font>

	<p></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It&#39;s an excellent book covering all aspects of 
	Linux security<br>
	from physical site security to VPN&#39;s. It&#39;s up to date: a good section with clear 
	examples on iptables is included. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For each section the author selects a few (or 
	as in the case of file integrity just one product like tripwire) products and 
	explains with good examples how to install and configure from scratch (including 
	installing the rpm&#39;s). The language is clear and the author explains both why 
	and how. There is an excellent section on nessus and the tripwire part really 
	shows what a cumbersome beast tripwire now has become ... The focus is almost 
	100% on freely available tools in true Linux spirit. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It&#39;s not without minor faults however - but so 
	far I have only found one major one. The section on &quot;Starting Network Services 
	from /etc/rc.d&quot; is weak: it messes up the runlevels (1 is single user and 5 
	is X11), it does not mention the fact that Kill scripts are run before the Start 
	script when _entering_ a new run level and there is no mention of ntsysv (or 
	chkconfig). </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I do like the fact that Hontanon is not at all 
	afraid of giving strong recommendations - i.e. &quot;Among the password auditing 
	tools ... John the Ripper stands out as the clear winner because of its performance 
	and ease of use&quot;. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is not a beginners book - it assumes general 
	Linux and networking knowledge. </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you are looking for a source for overall Linux 
	security, Unix security tools and how to use these tools look no further. This 
	book should be on your bookshelf along with the 2nd edition of &quot;Maximum Linux 
	Security&quot; and (the now slightly out of date) &quot;Practical Unix&amp;Internet Security&quot;.
	</font></p>

	<b>Buy two of these</b>, May 30, 2001 <br>
	Reviewer: <b>A reader</b> from Atlanta, GA, USA</font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
	I wasn&#39;t a fan of Hacking Exposed, largely because its Unix section was a mere 
	50 pages of superficial, outdated, and obvious fluff. Hacking Linux Exposed 
	makes up for that lack by digging into Unix in much more depth. Though it is 
	modeled after the attack/countermeasure style of the original HE, this book 
	includes a whole chapter of security measures at the beginning that you can 
	implement instantly to get your machine locked down before getting into the 
	nitty-gritty detail about other things in the hacker&#39;s arsenal.I was particularly 
	enthralled with chapter 10, which talks about what the hacker will do after 
	they have gained root access, from simple things like adding accounts to complicated 
	issues like kernel modules, complete with source code. Chapter 7 includes some 
	really wonderful examples of how the hacker can abuse networking protocols themselves, 
	something I haven&#39;t seen covered in such depth before.The book is logically 
	organized. The first part covers the way the hackers find and probe your machine. 
	The second talks about getting in from the outside, be it network or physical. 
	The third part talks about gaining additional priveleges, and the last part 
	of the book is dedicated to mail, ftp, web, and firewalls. The appendicies are 
	actually useful. They seem to have dropped the small 1-page case studies from 
	the original book and replaced them with longer hacker-eye-views of real attacks 
	which are an interesting read, and really tie the book together.This book is 
	Linux specific in it&#39;s countermeasures, but I&#39;d recommend this to any unix user. 
	They do a good job of discussing differences between Linux variants as well, 
	they don&#39;t just assume everyone has a RedHat box on their desk. Very refreshing.This 
	book is great for both the theory and practical uses. I could spend weeks implementing 
	all the suggestions they have, but they seem to have thought of this because 
	their risk ratings let you know where you should concentrate as you secure your 
	systems.Like Hacking Exposed, this book also has a website, (...) but it seems 
	more up-to-date -- for example when the ptrace bug in older kernels came out, 
	they posted a kernel module you could compile to protect your system until you 
	could upgrade -- and includes all the source code contained in the book.I bought 
	two of these, one for home and one for the office, and I suggest you do the 
	same.</font>  </p>

	This is only 400 pages books about pretty complex subject, but the book got 
	several very positive reviews. First four are so positives that I suspect some 
	of them might be &quot;friends and family&quot; type of reviews.  Judging from the 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0130281875/contents/ref=ref=nikolaibezroukov">
	Table of contents</a> the book covers (or at least mention) several important 
	areas including using Snort (mentioned in the ch. 15), Hardening (Ch 12). The 
	latter is a definite plus, although the items listed in this chapter has nothing 
	to do with tightening system setting and stripping the system to bones.<p>
	At the same time the chapter 13 title looks misleading (contents has nothing 
	to do with hardware)<p></p>

	<blockquote>

		<p><font size="2">13. Preparing Your Hardware.<br>
		Timing Is Everything. Advanced Preparation. Switch to Auxiliary Control 
		(Hot Backups). TCP Wrappers. Adaptive TCP Wrappers: Raising the Drawbridge. 
		Cracker Trap. Ending Cracker Servers with a Kernel Mod. Fire Drills. Break 
		Into Your Own System with Tiger Teams.</font></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And the content of chapter 9 &quot;Gutsy Break-Ins&quot; (Mission Impossible Techniques. 
	Spies. Fanatics and Suicide Attacks.) looks like an indication of snail-oil 
	salesmen style.<p>

	Reviewer: <b>Jonathan Low </b>from Sunnyvale, CA USA</font><br>
	This book is written in clear prose and is easily understood. His description 
	of attacks and how to defend against them is fascinating and extensive. He has 
	a section titled &quot;Obscure but Deadly Problems&quot;. I fear they are not as obscure 
	as one would hope, as I have encountered such problems. The historical notes, 
	such as that of the Symlink Attack (section 6.8.3 in the grey box on page 298), 
	allow the reader a deeper level of understanding. The resources and instructions 
	for finding the attacker&#39;s system given in chapter 20 are very useful.</font><br clear="left">

	Kevin Tsai </a></b>from Oakland, CA     
	<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="-1">December 29, 1999</font><p>
	<font size="2">I&#39;m a systems consultant and have worked with a number of different 
	firewall products including FireWall-1. FireWall-1&#39;s network address translation 
	feature is very powerful if you manually set up network objects and the local.arp 
	file and configure the NAT rule. This book does even touch on these aspects; 
	the Arch&amp;Admin (that comes with the Firewall-1 CD) explains this in detail in 
	65 pages. *Copied from the CD documentation: for example, the discussion on 
	SYN Flooding Attack (pages 138-143) is mostly taken WORD-FOR-WORD from Arch&amp;Admin 
	(pages 329-333). Many examples are copied verbatim. *PPTP is not secure relative 
	to alternatives - why recommend it? I thought the authors were veterans. *Checkpoint&#39;s 
	OPSEC makes FireWall-1 extensible, and a couple of the add-ons such as RealSecure 
	(attack recognition) and StoneBeat (high availability) are very complementary 
	products. I&#39;d expect professionals who&#39;d write a book on FireWall-1 to have 
	experience in these add-ons. *Of the 450 pages, only the first 306 pages are 
	FireWall-1 related; the next 100 pages (Chapter 13) are on generic Internet 
	attacks &#8730; which many books cover more in content and detail. Balance is glossary 
	and index (that&#39;s over 10% of the book). *Stripping down NT: the first thing 
	you should do before installing FireWall-1 on NT is strip all the services from 
	the network control panel applet. I guess the authors didn&#39;t even bother to 
	copy Joe DiPietro.</font>

	<p><font size="2">This book does not cover anything on FireWall-1 that the software 
	documentation from Checkpoint does not cover. As a matter of fact, Checkpoint&#39;s 
	documentation covers much more depth AND breadth than this book. From what I 
	understand, the only documentation on FireWall-1 that is better than Checkpoint&#39;s 
	is Checkpoint&#39;s Hebrew version of the documentation.</font> </p>

	<p><font size="2">For the price of this book, I&#39;d expect more in-depth coverage 
	on the technical deployment of the product (for the technical implementer), 
	on the strategic deployment of the product (for the CIO), or both. This book 
	provides neither. Stick with the CD&#39;s documentation.<br>

	<br>
	The great advantage of the book is that it is available in HTML.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
	really make it better than it was before and added an additional star in my 
	evaluation ;-).<br>
	<br>
	It&#39;s a good introduction to the subject. Somewhat outdated -- four years old 
	in a very dynamic field, Rootkit is not even mentioned, Bugtraq mentioned only 
	in supplement, etc. Far from being practical and can be used only as a general 
	introductory text in Unix security. Not recommended for Internet security (superficial 
	and incomplete). Good style --&nbsp; Simson Garfinkel of The UNIX-Haters Handbook 
	fame&nbsp; is a really talented journalist (but now only a journalist, see his 
	interview with Amazon.com). <br>
	<br>
	The main problem with the book is that instead of relying on tools as any Unix 
	author should, the authors use a cookbook/reference approach giving recipes 
	about improving security. References to important RFCs, FAQ and CERT advisories 
	are absent. For example RFC1244 (now superseded by RTC2196) is not mentioned 
	in index (and probably in the text as well) although Ch.2 and Ch.24 mirror its 
	content.<br>
	<br>
	No attempts were made to explain what tools can be used for checking/fixing 
	particular class of problems or to present a bigger picture in which the flaw 
	exists. Typesetting is very primitive. Although one of the authors is a (former) 
	programmer judging by just the book content it is difficult to believe that 
	he is able to spell PERL :-).<br>
	<br>
	The book is not updated enough to compete with newer books on Internet Security. 
	For corporate users possible alternatives are combinations of one book on Unix 
	security (for example,&nbsp; one book on tools like&nbsp; <b>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130158070/ref=nikolaibezroukov">
	Linux System Security: The Administrator&#39;s Guide to Open Source Security Tools</a></b> 
	and one book on Internet security (for example Actually Useful Internet Security 
	Techniques by Larry J. Hughes or some more recent book on network security).<br>
	<br>
	Often non-security books written by a specialist in particular area can be a 
	better deal than books from security folks. For example TCP/IP Network Administration 
	by Craig Hunt contains a lot more information about how properly configure TCP/IP 
	than this book and in Ch.12 has a very decent overview of security in just 40 
	pages.<br>

	<b>Excellent General Introduction</b></font>

	<p><font size="2"><b>Mark R. Lindsey (puis-book-review-amazon@mark.datasys.net)
	</b>from Valdosta, Georgia, USA April 25, 1999</font> </p>

	<p><font size="2">This is a superb discussion of networked-system security, 
	in general. It doesn&#39;t pretend to be an up-to-the-minute shopping list of security 
	flaws: that job is better left to web sites. Instead, the text educates readers 
	with a conceptual idea of Computer Security that can be applied successfully 
	to existing systems, and to systems not yet built. It&#39;s exactly the sort of 
	educational value that we&#39;d expect from simsong and spaf.</font> </p>

	<p><font size="2">But it does go beyond theoretical education, to explain with 
	great clarity fundamental issues in system security. Covering everything from 
	physical security to filesystem quirks, this tome is fascinating in its scope. 
	I have found the special section on writing solid network applications (CGI 
	programs, and the like) to be of great value.</font> </p>

	<p><font size="2">In short, this book provides the Common Body of Knowledge 
	in computer security. Start here, and you&#39;ll have the basis for a comprehensive 
	understanding of related issues -- one that transcends the individual bugs to 
	see the bigger picture.</font></p>

	from CA, USA , May 12, 1998 **</b></font><br>
	<b>outdated and light on internet security</b><br>
	I should have paid more attention when I bought this book in a series of security 
	books and I regret this buy. Its &quot;best seller&quot; position is IMO unjustified because 
	the networking/internet sections (10 total lines on SSL!, mentions of Netscape 
	2.0b2, nothing on ICMPs attacks, 3 lines about spoofing...) are completly outdated 
	and/or pretty useless.</font></p>

	<b>Disappointing</b><br>
	Had this book cost me $5, I would&#39;ve been perfectly happy with it, but for over 
	$30... These people have written a lot, but said little. They did mention a 
	few things to watch out for, but this could&#39;ve been fit in under 50 pages. The 
	rest is reiteration of trivial. Some topics, like cryptography, were a bait, 
	but haven&#39;t been covered in depth. And, boy, about a third of the book talks 
	about stuff from intro UNIX texts. I tend to think that people concerned with 
	UNIX security know how to move between directories. Also worth knowing that 
	Garfinkel co-authored so called &quot;UNIX haters notebook&quot;. His prejudice shows.</font></dd>

	[Preface]<br>
	</a></dd>
	<dd><b>Semi-decent book on open source security tools. It&#39;s not Linux specific</b>. 
	The book that beats a lot of&nbsp; mediocre books like Maximum Security (by 
	anonymous) or Solaris Security( by Peter Gregory) to name a few, but still is 
	not without significant flaws: the author does not understand half of the tools 
	he is writing about.

	<p>Actually all tools described are not Linux specific and can be used for any 
	Unix including FreeBSD and Solaris. First several chapters (2-4) are pretty 
	superficial (for example huge and non-trivial problem of assigning and maintaining 
	user groups on a production server&nbsp; is covered in half-page) and contain 
	almost no useful information, but tools chapters are better and some of them 
	are really useful.<br>
	<br>
	The authors seems really used tools that they are writing about although they 
	never go into fine details that is typical for real experts. For several popular 
	tools the book provides some useful info that is difficult to find elsewhere. 
	Pretty decent typography, although it&#39;s a little bit too academic and does not 
	use icons on margins that IMHO simplify reading.<br>
	<br>
	As for the classic open security tools, the book covers PAM(36 pages), Sudo(20 
	pages), TCP Wrappers(24 pages), SSH(55 pages), Tripwire(24 pages), CFS and TCFS 
	(30 pages), and ipchains.<br>
	<br>
	From the first reading it looks like at least some &quot;tools&quot; chapters are *not* 
	a rehash of existing online documentation. In addition to the chapters about 
	classic open source security tools I like chapters about logs: a chapter on 
	syslog (Ch.8) and a chapter on log file management (Ch.17).<br>
	<br>
	Now about weaknesses. The chapter on Tiger is extremly weak. The second author 
	of the book ELLEN L. MITCHELL is a network analyst at Texas A&amp;M University, 
	responsible for campus network security, development, and administration. She 
	currently maintains the Tiger UNIX security package, but is unable to maintain 
	a pretty simple set of hardening scripts :-(.&nbsp; That&#39;s due her efforts, 
	Tiger is now a legacy tool :-). Actually information is not completely useless 
	-- it&#39;s not difficult to switch to another tool after one understands how Tiger 
	works. Titan can be considered for Solaris. Perl is superior for writing Unix 
	vulnerability scanners in comparison with shell, but Bastille is no way a better 
	set of scripts than outdated Tiger. From the point of view of architectural 
	solutions Tiger is much stronger (that the polite way to way that Bastille is 
	junk). <br>
	<br>
	There are several serious omissions. Book is incomplete in a sense that neither 
	Snort (or any similar intrusion detection tool), nor open source network scanners 
	(Saint, Sara, etc.) are covered. Nmap is not covered as well.<br>
	<br>
	Of course there are some typos, but generally not that many. But what is really 
	bad is that the Prentice Hall book page
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.phptr.com/ptrbooks/ptr_0130158070.html">
	http://www.phptr.com/ptrbooks/ptr_0130158070.html</a> currently is pretty basic 
	with no errata or additional links. The authors do not provide a WEB site for 
	the book. That is a really bad sign :-(.<br>
	<br>
	This book can probably be used for studying Unix security at universities along 
	with somewhat outdated
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1565921488/ref=nikolaibezroukov">
	Practical Unix and Internet Security</a>&nbsp; and this combination can somewhat 
	compensate deficiencies of the latter (non tool oriented descriptive approach).&nbsp;

	<dd>The main purpose of the book is to serve as an advertisement of the authors 
	hacking courses. The main strength of the book is that it contains a useful 
	tips about networking utilities and security tools as well as a basic assortment 
	of networking attacks.&nbsp; From other point of view there is a difference 
	between openness and provoking people to do something wrong. There is a very 
	fine line here. I wondered at times whether some parts of the book were written 
	with the &quot;Anarchist&#39;s Cookbook.&quot;&nbsp; in mind :-). Still, there is some good 
	content here. For example as for tools&nbsp; the book does contain some relevant 
	information. You can probably can save some time that otherwise will be spent 
	browsing the Internet starting from the set of tools outlined in the book.<p>
	The authors did not produce the coherent picture of what is what and the book 
	is fragmentary. It&#39;s more like a collection of notes or a reference of useful 
	tools.&nbsp; Paradoxically Unix part of the book is extremely weak. Looks like 
	neither of the authors understand Unix well.</p>

		<p><font size="2">There are many topics that received excellent coverage

		<p><font size="2">Topics that could have been left out of this book or that

		<font size="2">I&#39;ve read about 4 security books and this book was far better 
		than the rest. Instead of simply telling you not to run a certain service 
		cuz it might have a hole, it actually tells you what the hole is, how to 
		exploit it, and where to get the tools you need to exploit it. This isn&#39;t 
		a list of programs and their holes though, it starts at the begining teaching 
		you how to enumarate (get info) from a computer from all kinds of different 
		methods, such as trying to find out OSs, their versions, services that are 
		running and who is currently on the system. It talks about scanning groups 
		of computers to find the few that are exploitable. It then goes on to explain 
		specific Windows9X holes, then NT, to Novell, and then to Unix. Spending 
		upto 60 pages on each operating system (very in depth and all of it usefull). 
		There are also chapters just on dialup and VPNs (virtual private networks), 
		firewalls, network hardware (routers) and an entire chapter just about DoS&#39;s 
		(Denial of Services). It then goes into Advance Techniques, problems with 
		PHP and ASP, and then onto a chapter on Windows2000 (talk about being up 
		to date). As far as my book collection goes, this definetly gets my Top5 
		rating of the 100+ books I&#39;ve read. Theres alot of meat to eat in this book.</font><br>

		<b>Incomplete, shallow and too diverse</b>, October 19, 2000<br clear="left">
		Reviewer: <b>R. van den Berg </b>from Netherlands<br>
		</font><br>
		If you know nothing about hacking, this book might be a good start. However, 
		there are plenty of web sites that will do a better job (and they are free).<br>
		<br>
		The reputation of the authors made me hope for a much more in depth look 
		at hacking techniques. Instead, <b><i>they touch on most subjects way too 
		lightly, and making several failed attempts in explaining some basic networking 
		concepts.</i></b><br>
		What I thought to be the most value when reading, was the promise of a website 
		with all the links mentioned in the book. As of today, this site is &quot;under 
		construction&quot; without any useful information at all! (www.internettradecraft.com)<br>
		In short, <b><i>if you want to get a basic feel for what hacking is about, 
		and want to get it without using a web browser, read this book. If you&#39;re 
		looking to expand your knowledge or get definite answers, look elsewhere.</i></b></font></p>

		OK, I did it again, I bought another useless &#39;hackers book&#39;. As before, 
		it is basically my fault, since I chose to (by my own free will). Unlike 
		before, however, the disappointment is a lot higher, since the authors (I 
		know their works) are capable of a far better product. It can be the diversity 
		of styles, or some kind of auto censure, or whatever, but the book looks 
		basically naive, and the content is very weak. <b><i>It seems to me as if 
		while trying to be formal, the authors banalized and/or obscured the issues 
		under discussion.</i></b> <b><i>The bottom line is a mosaic of generic topics 
		that you can easily find (better treated) following common security links.</i></b> 
		As for the claims of Mr. Russell (back cover), besides being truly OPTIMISTICS, 
		they seem like referring to a different book! I am still amazed by a the 
		fact that he can really believe that after reading the book, the term &#39;blind 
		spoof&#39; will be correctly understood! Half page of obscure information (using 
		a non-representative example) with at least a misplaced term, doesn&#39;t seem 
		the way to explain this kind of spoof (you can find better information in 
		Morris original document). Besides, the &#39;explanation&#39; aims to describe some 
		scanning possibilities instead of real blind attacks. Not a mention to modern 
		forms of prevention (e.g., Syn-Cookies, Firewalling, etc.).</font>

			<td colspan="2"><font size="2">I wanted to like this book, seeing as 
			how I&#39;ve made intrusion detection an important part of my career (the 
			book spends a few pages discussing a paper I wrote), and there are no 
			good offline resources on the subject. Unfortunately, I found little 
			to appreciate in this book, which could have benefited greatly from 
			better technical editing, a sharper concept of what its audience is, 
			and (unfortunately) a better grounding in the subject matter.</font>

			<p><font size="2">The most important problem with this book will be 
			obvious to most readers. Escamilla doesn&#39;t address the subject of intrusion 
			detection until midway through the book, opting instead to fill the 
			first half of the book with background information about computer security. 
			This information is presented poorly (and with glaring inaccuracies). 
			Almost all of it is covered better in other books, which readers unfamiliar 
			with network security will need to buy anyways to make the intrusion 
			detection concepts discussed in the latter half of the book accessible.</font>
			</p>

			<p><font size="2">Unfortunately, the relevant half of the book isn&#39;t 
			much better. A confused mish-mash of technologies are presented under 
			the banner of I-D (I know of very few people in the security industry 
			who consider security scanners to be I-D systems), and the most widely 
			used forms of I-D are given scant coverage.</font> </p>

			<p><font size="2">Worse still, the author profiles real commercial I-D 
			systems (towards the end of the book). Apart from the fact that this 
			information was unsalvageably outdated before the book made it to the 
			press, it&#39;s also biased. Descriptions of one system span 3 pages, while 
			another merits a single paragraph. Many important systems (which were 
			widely known at the time of this book&#39;s release) are not covered at 
			all. And, predictably, most of the details about the commercial systems 
			covered read like marketing material, with almost no comparisons to 
			the other systems covered.</font> </p>

			<p><font size="2">Although this book is a mess, it&#39;s not an unrecoverable 
			one. The authors descriptions of Do-It-Yourself intrusion detection 
			on Unix systems is competant, if not revolutionary, and is almost reminiscent 
			of Cheswick and Bellovin&#39;s work in _Firewalls_and_Internet_Security_. 
			A better informed, more coherent second revision of this book would 
			be worth looking at.</font> </p>

			<p><font size="2">Unfortunately, there&#39;s very little to recommend this 
			book. A critical and informed reader might get some value out of it, 
			but nothing that couldn&#39;t be obtained more easily from the Internet. 
			At its worst, however, this book can be misleading, and is thus an inappropriate 
			introduction to its subject. Overall, a deeply flawed book. Steer clear.</font></p>

	exposed&quot; one can probably expect a decent level. Not true.<br>
	<br>
	The book can probably be partially useful for beginning Unix administrators, 
	but in no way it can be considered a Solaris Security book.<br>
	<br>
	First of all the useful content is almost absent. If you skip first 23 pages 
	and appendixes you might find that you have bought less than 150 horribly typeset 
	pages of general information useful only for beginning Solaris sysadmins, if 
	any.<br>
	<br>
	The quality of the book can be illustrated by the folowing quote (preface, page 
	XLI):<br>
	ftp://ftp.win.tne.nl/pub/security/tcp_wrappers_7.6tar.gz<br>
	<br>
	This archive was compromised more than two years ago and is now defunct so putting 
	such URL in the book looks unprofessional. And the value of this recommendation 
	is pretty obvious.<br>
	<br>
	Now about important tools: Aset is covered in just one page. COPS in one-half, 
	Tiger -- one half, Tripwire in one. None of the modern tools are covered at 
	all. After that statistic one might wonder why the book is called Solaris security. 
	Well, that&#39;s probably gives you an idea.</p>

	<p>I agree completely with the following review of the reader from New Hampshire, 
	but I would give one&nbsp; stars instead of two.</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p><font size="2"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><b>** A reader from 
		New Hampshire, US , October 13, 1999</b></font><br>
		<b>Very basic, riddled with errors and typos</b><br>
		They should have named this book &quot;Beginning Solaris Administration with 
		a touch of Security&quot;. This book presents basic system administration techniques, 
		many of them extremely obvious or simple common sense. Security is glossed 
		over very quickly with little to no &#39;meat&#39;. &quot;We recommend running COPS or 
		Tiger to audit this weakness, see Chapter 4.&quot; Chapter 4 includes a one paragraph 
		note on COPS.</font> </p>

		<p><font size="2">In addition to the lack of any real content, like all 
		recent computer books, this one is rife with errors and typos. Example: 
		The chapter on DNS--the author continually comments on blocking port 43 
		at the firewall to prevent DNS queries and zone transfers. Everyone knows 
		that DNS uses port 53--in fact, the author notes that in a table 10 pages 
		earlier. I would just attribute this to a typo, but he mentions port 43 
		at least 5 times on one page.</font> </p>

		<p><font size="2">I expected better of SUN and Prentice-Hall, but I guess 
		I should have known better based on the Janice Winsor books.</font></p>
