<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2011/09/02/updated-ssl-certificate-for-messagingnengine-com/'>Updated SSL certificate for messagingengine.com</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash;  1 September 2011</p>
<p>Our existing SSL certificate for messagingengine.com was going to expire
in the near future, so we updated it with a new one. The new one has a
longer key as well, making it technically more secure as well. For 99%
of users there was no noticeable change, things just continued to work
as expected.</p>

<p>However because of the longer key, the new certificate has a slightly
different root signing CA. It seems a few pieces of email software
(mostly Eudora and some fetchmail installations) don’t have this new CA
built in, and so have been complaining about the authority of
mail.messagingengine.com when you try and send or receive email with an
SSL connection.</p>

<p>Eudora: To fix this, after you get the connection error, you do the
following (from the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/kb/2323hq.html">Eudora help
site</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the Personalities Window,Right Click on the Personality in
  question and select Properties: Incoming Mail: Last SSL Info: then go
  to the Certificate Manager and select the SSL Certificate in question.
  Click Add to Trusted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For fetchmail, please <a href="http://fastmail.wikia.com/wiki/ConfiguringFetchmail">follow the updated instructions on our
wiki</a>.</p>

<p>For other email software that doesn’t have the right CA certificate, you
can download them and install them into your software. Since this is
different for every piece of software, you’ll have to lookup the help
for your particular system. The new root and intermediate certificates
are:</p>
