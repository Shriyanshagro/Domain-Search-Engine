My take away was that if you foster a school climate of acceptance, respect, and relationships, you set the stage for students to take care of each other.  You also insure that students feel comfortable reporting incidence of bullying and harassment, and are therefore able to address those issues quickly and efficiently. We were already focusing this year on community building, but we're paying special attention this November with a "Month of Thanks and Giving".  We want to focus on all the wonderful things that our students do everyday and celebrate them.  We are also the single largest provider for Feed My People and have our annual drive during November.  We plan to culminate in a day of celebration before Thanksgiving break.  We're pretty excited about it! Thank you for bringing him in!

He came to our training overly prepared and extremely well-organized.Dr. Hinduja has a vast knowledge and real passion for the topics of cyber-bullying and safe social networking, and that was very evident throughout the day.  He didn't need any fancy gadgets or tricks up his sleeve to get the audience mesmerized. The flawless way he delivered the information was enough.  In fact,  months later, I am still getting rave reviews about him.  Simply put- when he speaks, people listen.  His content is relevant and timely more today than ever.

You talked about the importance of influencing school climate and approaching it with a positive spin.  You stressed the importance of communicating to young people and shared some strategies in talking with children about on-line safety, social networking respect and general, common courtesy, like what takes place “in the Hinduja household.”  The sharing of your personal stories made it easy to relate and identify with you. The presentation was interesting, interactive and jam-packed with bullying and cyberbullying prevention tips.  We thoroughly enjoyed texting back responses and the videos viewed to stress a point.  Your support and involvement throughout the process in putting this presentation together was generous and kind.  You promptly responded to all questions and concerns, assisted in rearranging chairs to help make the room more conducive to the presentation, and offered your professional assistance in the future if a concern arises.  Additionally, you read the audience very well, sensing best when to offer a break and when to move to the next topic.

The parents walked away from their session with valuable information; we could easily have had an additional hour or two for dialogue and the exchange of thoughts.  The Middle School was also full of energy.  The students were enthusiastic and participated in various questions; they also left with an increased knowledge base.  The Upper School was great; the majority of the students were captivated by Dr. Hinduja’s knowledge, information and  wit.  The  flash polling was exceptional; it was a very interactive touch for the students with insightful questions and answers.

I love that stressed crucial aspects of the issue like creating awareness about the fact that it’s a small number of children/people who do this and also that the enemy might not necessarily be an outsider, stranger but a friend or a peer.  I appreciate the websites and information, data you provided and also the simple, “common sense”, tips for us parents.  Often times the little things are the ones that make the difference.   I love your perspective in general, I have not heard anyone talking about involving the bullies in the solution rather than blaming or punishing them.  It was awesome to see involved in activities that helped raised their consciousness about the harm they were/ could be causing. My son, a 9th grader, was also very impressed with your presentation.  He was actually very happy about the way the topic was discussed.

Even as an adult, I was a little apprehensive about sitting at a designated table, staring at unfamiliar faces, wondering how this would all go down, and could only imagine how the teens were feeling.Nonetheless, Dr. Hinduja quickly captivated our attention by asking us to take out our cell phones and respond to his posted question. Immediately I knew I would like this guy because the first thing he did was remind us that technology is here to stay and will only become more a part of our daily routine, in class or not. It’s not something we should be afraid of. We live in a time where we should embrace the technology and make sure others know how to use it safely and in a positive way.Not only did I enjoy the manner in which Dr. Hinduja delivered his ideas, but what he chose to speak about was relevant. Without a doubt, I’m sure attendees left the meeting with hearts full, wanting to make a difference, and taking with them the resources to do just that.Thank you Dr. Hinduja, for taking the time to share and make a difference.</p><div class="testimonial-author"><strong>Taylor Glover M.L.S., Library Media Specialist,</strong>Klein Collins High School</div></div></li><li><div class="cbp-qtcontent"><p class="testimonial">Great information - hope to use this information to inform parents and incorporate some into our safety lessons for our 4th and 5th graders.</p><div class="testimonial-author"><strong>Staci Haire,</strong>Elementary Counselor, Lowndes County Board of Education</div></div></li><li><div class="cbp-qtcontent"><p class="testimonial">Sameer’s presentations to students, faculty, and parents were all well-received. Students felt they could relate well to Dr. Hinduja. He understood the significance of technology in their lives and was respectful of them. He was funny and charismatic and connected with the kids appropriately. Sameer was able to deliver his message in a way that was accessible to all. One student compared the presentation to a similar one at her previous school and said that Sameer’s was so much better because he understands and relates to adolescents so well. Probably the greatest testimonial to the effectiveness of his message is that students and faculty related that they checked and changed their Facebook settings and culled their friends list as a result of the assembly. Parents were very thankful to receive information in a way that could open up communication channels with their children. Sameer does not use scare tactics but simply presents the challenges and opportunities of social networking in an authentic and accessible way.</p><div class="testimonial-author"><strong>David Rost,</strong>Dean of Students, Concord Academy</div></div></li><li><div class="cbp-qtcontent"><p class="testimonial">Very interesting workshop.

A group of middle school students had created a skit about exclusion, and the counselor made it available for all of the classes to view before their classroom meetings. One of the sixth graders, who has Cerebral Palsy, volunteered to act as the victim for the skit. The students could see the skit multiple times, and analyze the behavior of the bystanders. It was a roaring success. Next week, the students will be presenting a video about the difference between tattling and telling. I also have placed my Cyberbullying Trustee sign prominently on my office door, as well as on the podium of the school library. I have had a surprising number of adults approach me about internet security and social networking since the conference. I gave a lesson to the sixth grade about online publishing using the materials on your website. Even though that particular class has approached me often with defiance, they did seem to appreciate the information, dropping their attitudes and asking thoughtful questions.

He is clearly passionate about this topic and it is imperative that as many educators and parents as possible learn about this extremely disturbing aspect of technology in our world today.

Recently my daughter, a 7th grader, came home and spoke of your presentation. First of all she doesn’t share much about school so the fact she shared this was impressive. Secondly, it sounded like your presentation was very concrete and realistic - “I know you are going to do this so here’s how you can and still be safe” was the message that my daughter took away.

You offered three completely different yet equally effective workshops on cyberbullying and on-line safety (among numerous topics). The parents unanimously commented to me that your presentation was the best they had attended in this area. Your talk with them was factual, informative, poignant, supportive and emotional. Your presentations to our children in grades 3, 4 and 5 and then again to grades 6, 7 and 8 were equally informative but uniquely tailored to each age group. Additionally, you were authentic in your presentation and very personable, witty and caring. You captured their attention, ignited their interest and fostered instantaneous believability with all of them. The level of questioning from them indicates the level of trust you earned with them. At the end of three workshops you gave freely of your time in the faculty room so that you could be a resource to teachers seeking greater understanding and clarity. Bringing you to Meadowbrook was a stroke of genius and already there is a clamoring for return engagements. Thank you for your passion in this area, for educating our parents and teachers and for passionately striving to make our children safe.

An expert in his field, Dr. Hinduja’s deceptively youthful appearancegained him quick credibility with our students—a hip college professor connects well with those in middle and upper school. One aspect of his message was not especially new: Electronic postings last a lifetime even if “taken down” from original sites. Yet the advice he gave students was newly framed for them. Dr. Hinduja also focused as well on the world of cyberbullying, interspersing his lecture with YouTube videos made by teens who have suffered from the humiliating effects of campaigns waged against them.</p><div class="testimonial-author"><strong>Robert W.

Dr. Hinduja’s was very humorous, laid-back but yet very informative. I appreciated his speaking approach because it kept me alert and I was not bored with statistics. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about his work. It instantly inspired me to learn as much as I can on the topic, which is why, I immediately changed my schedule to be sure I attended his “Safe Social Networking and Adolescent Girls: Best and Worst Practices” session. Although I was aware of cyberbullying I was taken aback by the statistics of the common practice it has become, age of victims and aggressors, but most of all the intensity of the abuse. I appreciate the generosity of allowing us to access his free resources; it is a great help in implementing education and change amongst our youth. I walked out of the sessions with a new way of looking at combating the problem: technology is not the enemy but has to be our ally.

Several parents and the Principal of our school, Ms. Rogers, told me stories of how you impacted our kids. One 8th grade girl who rarely says anything about her day at school, jumped in the car and said “Mom, we had the most amazing speaker today!” Another 8th grader had the bad idea to talk meanly about a 7th grader that night on Facebook and the 7th grader followed your advice to gather evidence and printed it out and brought it to the principal the next day. Game over! My son who had been arguing with me about me having access to get on his Facebook agreed to let me be his “friend” on that web site. He also went into his account and took himself off several networks and changed his privacy settings to “friends only” as per your advice. Your specific advice andwonderful demeanor touched so many of our children today. We look forward to bringing you back to our school again and again.

He was flexible about the setting he spoke in, the size of the audience he spoke to, the time he was allowed to present in, and the busy schedule required of him.  Administrators appreciated having a copy of his book as a resource, students appreciated his real world cyber experiences, and I appreciated his passion for and expertise of his subject.

Before arriving, my expectations were not that high as I anticipated hearing the same message that I have heard at other conferences on this issue, “The Internet is dangerous,” “Protect your kids – limit their usage,” “Don’t let them use Facebook.” However, within a few minutes of hearing Sameer speak, I was encouraged that the message he presented was going in a different direction. He was not trying to “taint” the Internet or discourage it’s use. Rather, he promoted the importance of open dialog with our children and education on proper use. He highlighted the need for adults to be “safe havens” where children feel they can go when a problem does arise on the Internet, without the fear that they, as the victim, would be punished by losing their access to technology. He didn’t only talk about cyberbullying as being a problem, but he offered solutions. Good, applicable guidelines that educators, parents and students alike could implement. I appreciate the work he is doing in this field and his willingness to share many resources -for free – with others. I left the conference with a renewed sense of hope in being able to offer valuable feedback and resources not only to the youth and families that I work with, but to my own family as well.</p><div class="testimonial-author"><strong>Elizabeth J.

The positive feedback we received from all of these groups indicated that Dr. Hinduja opened a lot of eyes about the ever-growing problem of cyberbullying. His statistics and case scenarios were on target for each audience. Most importantly, he supplied every audience with specific strategies for keeping safe in cyberspace.

His message of using social media for positive outcome was communicated as was the importance of adult involvement in the digital life of kids. After each presentation, I received many compliments and our student body is already actively making plans to follow some of his suggestions.
