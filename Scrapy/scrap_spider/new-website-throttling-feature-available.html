<h1><a href='https://blog.fastmail.com/2010/01/17/new-website-throttling-feature-available/'>New website throttling feature available</a></h1>
<p class="blog-author">Rob Mueller &ndash; 17 January 2010</p>
<p>We recently had a users website come under a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDOS</a> attack.
The site itself was reasonably small (only a few HTML files and
downloadable files), but because the requests were coming in
continuously at several per-second from many different IP addresses, it
was quickly eating into the users available bandwidth.</p>

<p>To help with this, we’ve added a new throttling feature to websites,
that allows people to limit access rates to their websites from
individual IPs. On the <strong>Files</strong> –> <strong>Websites</strong> screen when you setup
or edit a website, you can change the <strong>IP Throttling</strong> to one of the
following values:</p>

<ul>
<li>10000/200M</li>
<li>2000/50M</li>
<li>500/20M</li>
<li>100/5M</li>
<li>20/2M</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2 values are “number of requests” and “bandwidth of requests” per-IP
per-10 minutes respectively. So setting the 10000/200M value will limit
each accessing IP to a website to no more than 10,000 requests and 200M
of data per 10 minutes. If a particular IP goes over one of the limits,
we’ll return an error page to requests from that IP for the given
website for the next 10 minutes.</p>

<p>In general, people shouldn’t need to change this value from the default
10000/200M, but if their site does come under some form of attack, this
will provide a way to help limit the damage.</p>
