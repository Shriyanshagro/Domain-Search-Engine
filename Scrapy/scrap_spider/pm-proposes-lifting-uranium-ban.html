  <p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard has set the stage for a showdown with her party's Left at Labor's national conference by back-flipping on the ALP's opposition to selling uranium to India.</p><p>In an opinion piece published in Fairfax newspapers this morning, Ms Gillard argues the move would strengthen Australia's relations with India, which possesses nuclear weapons but is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p><p>She says selling uranium to India for peaceful purposes will broaden Australian markets and increase jobs.</p><p>"We must, of course, expect of India the same standards we do of all countries for uranium export - strict adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency arrangements and strong bilateral and transparency measures which will provide assurances our uranium will be used only for peaceful purposes," she wrote.</p><p>"[We] must be prepared to confront difficult questions about maximising prosperity and the strength of our relationships in our region of the world."</p><p>Labor policy prohibits selling uranium to any country that is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the move will face opposition from the ALP's Left faction.</p><div class="inline-content quote right">

	<p>With the appropriate safeguards - yes.<br />And with regard to the PM stance on gay marriage, I find it impossible to fathom.<br />Where is it coming from? It is not as if she is in what she would regard as a &quot;traditional relationship&quot;.<br />There is so much hypocracy on this issue. Just look at the LNP in Queensland where Newman is strongly in favour of gay marriage but the party is voting against civil union legislation.<br />I am so over politicians!</p>

	<p>Well I was going to say no, how irresponsible is that?  But then I read that Ms Gillard said that we can make a lot of money.  As we all know, lots of money justifies absolutely anything, so now I'm all for it.</p>

	<p>Well, Si, I too was going to say no but your clear and persuasive argument has sold me. Now I'm for it.<br /><br />However, the uranium must be sold with a non-return policy. We don't want the dangerous waste brought back here and we certainly don't want any missiles bringing back explosive chunks of it.<br /><br />Oh, maybe for a few dollars we can have the waste brought back here, but I don't want it buried in my backyard, try somewhere in Canberra.</p>

	<p>Now your starting to see sense at last, try to see it my way, we can work it out. You can trust government to let us know if there will be any problems, just ask the people of Stockton in relation to the chemical plant by the sea in Newcastle. You can count on big buisness too, like banks &amp; insurance companies with tricky policies, they are there for us, the people, not the shareholders, they are here to make life easier &amp; more comfortable......more convenient.......just relax, let the government look after us, let big buisness help the government......they know what life is all about, they know what matters, they are the important ones.</p>

	<p>Yank, I'm not sure but I think it has something to do with India's possession &amp; their declared right to possess nuclear weapons themselves.  In 1968 when this treaty was drawn up the only countries who openly had nukes were USA, UK, USSR, France &amp; China.  The treaty sought to prevent any other country from developing their own nukes.  India, Pakistan &amp; Nth Korea refused to sign &amp; openly declared that they were going to or already did possess nuclear weapons.  The only country that is still sneaky about having nukes is Israel.</p>

	<p>Agree wholeheartedly.  Sales of uranium to India were Howard government policy. The ALP under Gillard /Rudd of course overturned that policy which has resulted in a deterioration of our diplomacy with India and loss of billions of export earnings in the last 4 years. Now Gillard reverts to Howards policy and claims it is Gillard 'moving forward' diplomatically in the Aisan decade. Gillard is just catching up to where the Liberals were in 2007.<br /><br />A bit of deja vu all over again. Reversion to Howard policies decried by Gillard are becoming the order of the day. Let's hope Gillard doesn't stuff this one up like her conversion to offshshore processing.</p>

	<p>Probably not.<br /><br />India's not exactly a rogue state, but they've chosen not to sign the non-proliferation treaty. Subjectively their reasons for this sound fair enough, but that's not the point. If our policy is only to supply NPT countries, then we can't just create exceptions for the countries we like - that defeats the whole purpose of having the NPT in the first place.</p>

	<p>China is in violation of the NPT, as it provided an atomic bob design to Pakistan in the 1980s. It also is in violation of NSG guidelines by setting up an unsafeguarded nuclear power plant in Pakistan. India wishes to join the NPT as a nuclear power. The NPT is archaic in any case.</p>

	<p>No - we should not be selling uranium....TO ANYONE!!!! Perhaps Ms Gillard would like to visit some of the following 'holiday destinations'....Maralinga, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl, Fukishima, Muroroa Attol....or that uranium mining company in Niger a year or so ago where terrorists took those French miners hostage....  all the worlds wonderful 'hot spots'! Do the 'politician thing' there Ms Gillard - kiss a few babies in those places....stare lovingly into their eyes and tell them that nuclear reactor fallout is great for them....  Did she see the report last week about how Japanese mums have bought Gieger counters to screen the food they buy because they don't trust anything the Japanese govt says about their locally produced food.... Ms Gillard might not care about the planet my kids are going to have to live on....but I do!</p>

	<p>Coal releases far more radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere than any intentional, incidential or accidential releases from nuclear weapons or facility accidents. Whilst the later is concentrated, burninig of coal results is a blanket across the world contaminating out water, air and soils. Whilst the levels to date have only been small, they are cumulative with the more coal that is burnt.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Just like not selling coal will not stop countries using coal the same applies to uranium not selling it does nothing as both can be supplied and are supplied by other countries so it achieves absolutly ZIP, just like the carbon tax  won`t achieve any drop in carbon pollution or make any impact on climate change</p>

	<p>Ahh anti-nuclear hysteria never ceases to amaze me. <br /><br />You know that you evolved in a radioactive environment, that you are exposed to radiation everyday of your life. Now that you know this I hope you don't run and lock yourself in a lead lined box with a dosimeter.<br /><br />Radiation is completely natural. Our bodies are designed to cope with radiation. That is how radiotherapy works to treat cancer. The internal tissue is exposed to high doses of radiation, the healthy cells repair themselves, while the dysfunctional cancer cells cannot heal themselves as quickly and thus the cancer is shrunk/treated.<br /><br />Also there are no radioactively mutated babies, what on earth have you been smoking? I can't believe that this myth is so well spread. Please refer to the National Academies paper Beir VII [2006] which states that it found that radiation-induced mutation in sperm and eggs is such a small risk that it has not been detected in humans, even in thoroughly studied irradiated populations such as those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Also clear statements by the WHO and UNSCEAR also exist on this topic.<br /><br />The Japanese hysteria regarding radioactive food is exactly that - hysteria. Of course mothers want to protect their children, but radiation is natural and the very tiny addition to background radiation that was the Fukushima accident will not harm any hysterical mothers with their 50 dosimeters. However, lots of people are making a great amount of money by spreading radiation fears, including the Japanese media.<br /><br />Please take a deep breathe, stop trying to scare people and get your facts straight.</p>

	<p>I too am absolutely ashamed that our Prime Minister would stoop to such depths of immorality.<br /><br />But I suspect that she is by no means alone in the the political world with no shortage of colleagues who would do exactly the same, given half a chance.<br /><br />Of course, if the Prime Minister does decide to sell Uranium to India, and to any other customer we might have or find, then here really is her chance to top up the federal government's (and the tax payers') coffers.<br /><br />Uranium should be subject to something like a &quot;safety&quot; premium.  How about to the tune of about 1,000% of the actual cost of the product.  Maybe more.<br /><br />For those willing to play with the dangers of the product, let them really pay for that willingness.  Perhaps the cost so recouped might go a little way towards offsetting the enormous costs that that mined Uranium will incur over the millennia, even if there are no actual safety issues.</p>

	<p>If it's a decision based on a new-found acceptability for nuclear weapons, the Australian people need to have it explained to us why it's not sensible for our own country to have them.<br /><br />If it's a decision based on a new-found acceptability for nuclear power production, the Australian people need to have it explained to us why it's not sensible to value-add the ore deposits we have, and develop our own domestic civil nuclear power grid.<br /><br />If it's a decision based on a new-found acceptability to unilaterally eschew long-standing international treaty obligations, the Australian people need to have it explained to us why the lawyer currently PM doesn't think this sets a dangerous precedent, setting an image of Australia as being more about &quot;jobs&quot; (read profits/votes) than regional and international stability.<br /><br />Coming off the back off the mess of Fukushima - and the media coverage didn't much help but make civil nuclear power anything but poison at the ballot box (at least in the short term) - how on Earth can the minority ALPers think this is a policy that won't further shrink their already severely dwindling base of support in the electorate?<br /><br />Rudd can trash talk the Greens with the best of them, but the Wikileaks revelations of how the Americans saw him (as out of his depth and a bit of a joke) really make one wonder how he can credibly spin this as competent handling of his portfolio - unless it's deliberate interference from Gillard to ruin his chances of regaining leadership? In any case, it does seem like policy far removed from good sense, security and the national interest. Gillard's strong views on gay marriage (in the absence of a hetero one herself, unless I've missed a news item) seem as soundly formulated as her currently espoused views on the nuclear question in relation to trade with India. If hardly nyone shares her view, it seems droning in the absence of reason is the order of the day. I guess that's why she got into politics, as it suits her skillset than remaining in the Law.</p>

	<p>Mick, this isn't about principles being sold out by a cash strapped government. It isn't even about non proliferation. This is about greater engagement in the 21st Century with 21st Century emerging powers. India wants to trade Uranium with us. The Indians rightfully see the hypocrisy in the ALP policy that allows Uranium exports to China &amp; Russia but not India. This ALP polcy is outdated and is embarrasing for a Labor government in 2011. Gillard, Ferguson et al are looking to eliminate a policy embarrasment at the Labor National Conference and so they should. Those who think that our Uranium must be left in the ground to make the world a safer place need to take a huge reality check.</p>

	<p>Yes, providing that it is a conditional sale and that Australia can freely inspect and carry out audits on its use.<br /><br />Australia should also consider being the repository for the return of radioactive waste resulting from the uranium we export. This is one fail safe way of ensuring that the uranium and its byproducts are only used for peaseful purposes. Australia has some of the most stable geology in the world and there are enormous opportunities for to be good 'world' citizens by ensuring the safe long term management of wastes.<br /><br />On another note, another flip flop by the Labor government is no surprise. There are few policy issues that one knows what Labor actually stands for as they flip and flop depending on what they think is in the best interest (for the polls).</p>

	<p>Current nuclear technology relies on another type of fossil fuel that is cleaner in immediate emissions, but incredibly dirty in its long term disposal.<br /><br />There are no solutions to this disposal problem.<br /><br />If uranium were to be sold to India, with the expectation it be used for Power, then what do we get for it?<br /><br />It would make sense to me that if such a dirty deal were to go ahead, then the Australian people should receive the benefit, and ALL profits should be used to fund the growth of the renewable sector, research and development into technologies and investment into the future renewable power technologies of Australia.<br /><br />Why not look at something like this as a potential opportunity to LEAP ahead of the rest, become the frontier for renewable power, make it cheap and effective for everyone then spread our business overseas, so that in 20-40 years time when nuclear power becomes obsolete, we have something to replace it with!<br /><br /><br />But, there's still that often overlooked issue of the clean up.... nobody ever speaks about cleaning up after these industrial waste technologies are used.....</p>

	<p>Nuclear Power will not become obselete. There are a thousand different ways to do nuclear power.<br /><br />Also the silver bullet energy solution already exists. It's called the Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactor (LFTR - pronounced as &quot;lifter&quot;) and is a type of Molten Salt Reactor. Have a look at some videos by Kirk Sorensen on YouTube and do some research. The LFTR is the future of energy and an inexhaustible, safe, reliable, cheap, clean, proven technology, green energy source.</p>

	<p>Considering all aspects of the use of Uranium and the risks posed by it, not only should Uranium not be sold to India, or any other customer for the purpose of energy generation, or enrichment, as the case may be, but it should not be mined in quantities greater than that which would normally be used for medical or scientific research purposes.  And by scientific research purposes, I do not include anything to do with large scale use such as weapons or explosives, or energy generation.<br /><br />The problem is that Uranium is probably the most expensive fuel for energy generation ever developed.  And that is coupled with the potential for massive, uncontrollable, and lethal, environmental pollution the dangers of which cannot be overstated.<br /><br />Should anyone be choose to dispute the statement above about the extreme expense of Uranium as fuel for energy generation, let me propose a couple of questions.  Firstly; How should a user of nuclear fuel dispose of the waste from that process?  The answer is of course, to do what has been done with virtually every gram of nuclear fuel used for peaceful purposes since its discovery, and that is to store it, because there is no known way to economically permanently dispose of it.<br /><br />The second question is; what is it going to cost, in monetary terms, to store this growing mountain of nuclear waste permanently?  The answer is clear.  No one has even a vague idea, for the life of that waste could well be tens of thousands of years, and in human economic terms, that is a very, very, long time to be paying the bill.<br /><br />Of course, like our politicians and Uranium miners with their vested interests, we could all just choose to ignore those costs, and heh presto!  Suddenly we have the cleanest and most economical energy source known to man.<br /><br />Imagination is a wonderful thing.</p>

Lock them up on islands and countries all over the place??<br />This &quot;boat people&quot; attitude is bollocks and inhumane.  <br /><br />It's not possible to stop people wanting something better for themselves, and Australia should take it as complimentary that others believe they'll be better off here... even amongst all the illegal immigration issues.  <br /><br />People smuggling is a problem.<br />People dying on rickety boats is a problem.<br />People being incarcerated for seeking asylum is a problem...<br /><br />But &quot;stopping the boats&quot; is no solution.<br /><br />I don't want to stand up for Gillard too much here, because I think she could be doing a lot better... but I look at Abbott and the ridiculous campaign the right are pushing these days, and it makes me cringe... makes me wonder what ludicrosity we can expect if either of these two stagnate governing bodies are allowed to have larger power...<br /><br />Get rid of 'em both.<br /></p>

	<p>There seems to be some amount of confusion here in the responses posted . Either you believe or do not believe in Nuclear energy as a clean energy alternative . If you do then selling uranium to china is no different to selling it to India.Withe the appropriate safeguards and that has already been agreed to by India in any case. Sticking to some vague moral principles like the left of the Labor party does , is a meaningless position to take with no rational basis. Are they against all uranium mining or are they for export to China but not India.   One a democracy and the other not. The Greens are quite clear they are against nuclear in any case. Economics and commercial interest does not bother them.</p>

	<p>No!  Once the uranium leaves Australia, there is no way to safeguard or to control its use, regardless of what ''oily talk'' may be happening at the moment.  And Australia lacks the means and the clout to challenge a misuse of this highly volatile product.  Given India's ongoing dramas with Pakistan, it would be irresponsible to allow uranium sales to India, or to anyone for that matter.  It's more than a bit disturbing, that in the past week, Ms. Gillard has decided upon a very unbalanced trade agreement with the US, has decided that a permanent US military presence in Darwin is somehow good for Australia and that sales of uranium to a very volatile region of the world is well and truly wonderful...And the old chestnut of jobs...jobs...jobs has been used, in large part, as the excuse.  These decisions should be made in Canberra, after vigourous and open debate in both houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p>Why not flog it to them, they can buy uranium from other countries if not from us so let's get on the bandwagon and make some money out of them.It's also a clean energy source and will help in a small way to get them off using dirty coal.</p>

	<p>On the balance I agree with this statement.<br /><br />I don't think India should be using nuclear power - if the Japanese can't do it safe, then who can?  And India is so densely populated, especially in the Ganges floodplain, that a mishap would poison and displace an overwhelming amount of people.  Especially if it gets into the silt of the braided river's floodplains.<br /><br />However, India already has enough uranium and suppliers to make bombs if they wanted to, and it is their choice to risk making power from it.  So if we mine it to sell and we already sell it to (arguably) rogue states like the USA and Russia, then why not to the World's biggest democracy?</p>

	<p>Yep, and about time too.  Australia sends military aid to Pakistan and sells uranium to China while refusing to sell uranium to a non-expansionist, friendly, government. This is unfathomable.

	<p>Uranium is, at best, a convenient way to produce so-called, environmentally friendly energy.  (It is not in reality, but it is portrayed thus).<br /><br />For most countries on earth, India included, there is a much more environmentally friendly method for generating power.  Not as convenient, but infinitely safer and certainly less expensive.<br /><br />The sun delivers an average of about 900 Watts of power to every square metre on this planet for, on average, about 10 hours each day, give or take a hundred Watts or so.<br /><br />Multiply that by the available surface area in most countries, including India, and the potential for energy capture is factorially greater than would probably be available from every last gram of Uranium available to miners.<br /><br />Surely this is the time to get on with developing the technology to extract this energy with considerable urgency, rather than flirt with the potential problems of Uranium used as fuel for energy.<br /><br />It clearly is the time.  But how can we persuade our politicians that it is in the best interests of their subjects for them to get off their convenience chairs and start doing something serious about it?</p>

	<p>If we possessed 100% of the worlds supply of uranium not selling yellow cake would matter, but we only possess 30%. Therefore this is reduced to a moral issue. Taking a moral stand does not cut the supply of yellow cake to other countries, it just raises its price because supply is reduced, but  not enough to be significant anyway. So, sell it and sleep well and think of your children as you drive them to school the next day belching out carbon and pollutants as you go. Plan how you will keep them safe in the future, and its not by some nebulous idea that your personal moral stand can sway the apparent direction of the entire human species.</p>

	<p>Ghandi is pro nuclear power. He unlike many Australian's doesn't buy into the anti-nuclear hysteria.<br /><br />Wealth and prosperity has been proven to be linked to availability and production of energy. It is the ultimate raw material. Who are you to deny the Indian people the right to expand their energy use? It will undoubtedly lead to better living conditions for their people. Some westerners may indeed waste energy, but they also live very comfortable lives. I would not hold it against anyone to wish for better living conditions or western living conditions.<br /><br />Large scale wind and solar projects are expensive and don't compete with coal and gas. If we are to have any hope of preventing runaway climate change we need nuclear energy. <br /><br />But you want India, a developing country with many bigger issues to worry about to develop your clean energy solution? Even though engineering giants like Germany and Japan have yet to find an energy silver bullet, you expect a country with millions of people below the poverty line to just &quot;stick it out&quot; and come up with a better energy solution for us all? You would deny them the right to live in prosperity and tell them to just &quot;use less power&quot; when per capita they consume a fraction of the energy of an average westerner??? Your naivety is astounding!<br /><br />To cap it off you want us to pretend that the nuclear genie never came out of the bottle and just turn our back on one of the best energy sources ever discovered and used by mankind? It may have been discovered 60 years ago, but developments in nuclear physics is a big part of the reason why you can sit behind your computer and preach your ridiculous ill-informed impractical and insensitive wishful thinking. Wake up Australia.</p>

	<p>But school children don't generate wealth, so your argument is kind of... errm.. emotive, I might think.<br /><br />A better argument might be to say, selling drugs to responsible adults... which is a far murkier debate.<br /><br />It all depends on who you're selling to, what the problems inherent with the product are and where the wealth generated is going.  <br /><br />I don't imagine that this deal would make Australia (as a whole) better off, but merely use our nation as a primary resource mine for a few years, until it's all gone... and then what?  Companies move off shore, we have no high tech industry nor renewable power solutions... <br />So we get screwed over.  And we don't even take any responsiblity for the resources from our Earth..</p>

	<p>Yes we should. Indian living standards are going to rise whatever little Australia decides to do, and that means they're going to be building more power plants. We have a choice to either help them build lots of coal power plants, and damn the environmental consequences, or help them build nuclear power plants, which can fill their electricity needs without adding to our climate change problems.<br /><br />And looking at the safety issues, India is actually right at the forefront of nuclear power research and development. They are one of the few countries who are giving serious attention to thorium reactors, which are generally considered to offer a cleaner, safer and more long-term option than uranium.<br /><br />They're not being held back by the irrational, hyperventilating, unscientific fear of anything 'nuclear' like we are here in Australia. I hold no hope that we might overcome that stupidity any time soon, but if we can support a country to push forward nuclear power technology - the only realistic option to replace coal and gas power - then for goodness sake let's do it!</p>

	<p>Why not produce the nuclear weapons at home, and then sell them to India? That would make us even more money and create even more jobs. What, because it's just the uranium, the moral issue just disappears?<br /><br />We need to bolster our secondary-stage export production not pawn all our resources off like the pimp of the asia-pacific region.

	<p>While it's a great idea for Australia to be selling uranium for purely power generation, the fact is that india hasn't yet signed the non-proliferation treaty. The issue is that certain aspects of the treaty they have a reasonable issue with (ie it says that noone that got nukes after a point in the 60's should have them is largely arbitrary) but large swathes of the treaty are very important, mostly relating to transfer of technology etc. These issues need to be better dealt with. The nuclear supplier group (a similar to the NPT but with some different rules) should ensure there are proper safeguards, which I have to say will be very difficult, since any uranium we sell will allow more of indias domestic uranium to be available for a weapons program.<br /><br />We need to replace coal and we need to do it asap, coal releases more radiation into the atmosphere than nuclear anyway, and frankly until we have either fusion or a room temperature super-conductor for storage I don't see any other baseload source other than fission nuclear.<br /><br />That this country has no nuclear power program is a scandal, abetted by all three parties who have some selfish vested interest group to the detriment of the country. Liberals have the coal industry, labor have the Transport worker union that transport the coal, and the greens who have an anti-technolgy minority inside the party that don't like anything invented since 1750. Money or ego, either way those groups win out while the rest of australia loses.</p>

If India can't sign the non proliferation treaty then they can't have our uranium it is so simple.

	<p>Once again a brilliant example of money hungry two faced politicians!<br /><br />Yep lets sell a lethal mineral to a country that cant afford to feed its people let alone the up keep and maintenance of a nuclear power plant, to a country that has potential terrorist on their door steps oh and lets not forget the floods the country has yearly.<br /><br />What a brilliant idea!<br /><br />Hey heres another idea solar power and wind power, there is plenty of sun in India and no chance a fall out and no radioactive waste coming back to Australia or dumped in the Indian country side. <br /><br />Dont forget this is not a environmental aware country the majority of the population live in poverty.  <br /><br />Lets help get India up to speed with the environment and renewable resources for a country that has the highest population that would be a fantastic win for all.<br /><br />But of course the Labor party wont make any money from this and they only care about the environment when they can tax the Australian public or make money<br /><br />What a slap in the face for the Australian public heres a carbon tax but we now want to sell Uranium to India.<br /><br />Question PM do you really thing the Australian public is so gullible and stupid? <br /></p>

	<p><br />NO, a thousand times no unless we are aiming to be involved in nuclear war in the not too distant future. <br />What else is it to be used for??? the intelligent countries are getting rid of their polluting industries but of course it is OK for India, they have lots of people so it is OK to shorten their lives.<br />But then of course there is big dollars in it.

	<p>If it were purely a matter of trust people would not feel compelled to train for a drivers license they would simply give an assurance that they would drive carefully. The repercussions of our uranium freeing up India's uranium to a military purpose is very dangerous given that Pakistan and India had long had issues.</p>

	<p>Australia should stick to its policy of only selling to those who have signed the non proliferation treaty.<br /><br />To do otherwise, start picking out and selling to some favorites is a perilous path - a slippery slope.<br /><br />One clear criteria should apply - Signatory to non proliferation treaty!</p>

	<p>No! This is all profit based and not in the best interest of the world.<br /><br />India should sign up to the convention before we send any bomb making materials to them.<br /><br />Sure our yellowcake might not go to a bomb, but indirectly it is, as the other yellowcake from other sources will be diverted from power to bombs. In effect we are providing the materials indirectly.</p>

	<p>Given the yellow uranium can't be used to make bombs it's a start,<br /><br />But it will free up other uranium sources which can for India as well.<br /><br />i think we need to ensure that India signs what ever is necessary to align them with aus/uk etc standards for non-proliferation,<br /><br />i also think it is the PM's way of differentiating more from Greens politically,<br /><br />i expect we all will be watching this space closely</p>
