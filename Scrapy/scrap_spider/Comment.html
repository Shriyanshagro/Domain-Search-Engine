    <h2 id="comment">Team Comment on "Binary RDF Representation for Publication and Exchange (HDT)" Submission</h2>
    
    <p>W3C is pleased to receive the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/03/">Binary RDF Representation for Publication and Exchange (HDT) Submission</a> from DERI Galway.</p>

    <p>The Submission proposes a binary representation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graphs</a> intended for efficient transfer. The term dictionary and the graph encoding (e.g. integer arrays or bitmaps) can be broken up across multiple resources. The HDT Submission defines extensions to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/NOTE-void-20110303/">VoID</a> vocabulary to provide metadata related for HDT formats, graph statistics and a general category of publication items.</p>

    <h3>Implementations</h3>

    <p>There is an open source implementation, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hdt-it/">HDT-It!</a>, documented in a <a href="/Submission/2011/SUBM-HDT-Implementation-20110330/">separate document</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="exist">Relationships to W3C Activities</h3>

    <p>Efficient interchange of RDF graphs is clearly relevant to the Semantic Web Activity. However, there is, at the moment, no Working Group that would actively pursue this line of work.</p>

    <p id="exi">While the current <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Main_Page">RDF Working Group</a> is working on a standard for Turtle, the current standard serialization for RDF is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF/XML</a>. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">Efficient XML Interchange Working Group</a> has standardized a binary format for XML. Tensions exist between re-using an existing standard and creating a new standard, more tightly coupled to the RDF data and query model:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>EXI is done</dt>
      <dd>EXI is specified, implemented and debugged; there is a substantial community who already understand it.</dd>

      <dt>model-specificity</dt>
      <dd>EXI produces XML, requiring an e.g. RDF/XML SAX handler to produce RDF triples; HDT is framed directly in terms of the RDF graph data model.</dd>

      <dt>RDF/XML's open content model</dt>
      <dd>RDF/XML's EXI encoding will produce heavy tag dictionaries and light CDATA dictionaries; we're unsure if that's optimal either in theory or in common implementation. Benchmarking the encoding time and final size of large RDF graphs would clarify this impact.</dd>

      <dt>re-applicability of model</dt>
      <dd>HDT's format is useful in memory or memory-mapped files in that the indexing favors common query navigation paths through RDF graphs.</dd>

    </dl>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

    <p>It is possible that a future Working Group will standardize a binary serialization for RDF, taking this Submission as input. The use cases presented by this Submission, as well as performance metrics that discriminate HDT from RDF/XML over <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/exi/">EXI</a>, will serve as input for future work on EXI.</p>
